MARCHING<br>
INTO GERMANY</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE DISGUISED OFFICER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We’ll</span> hold this position, boys, if we die for
it,” exclaimed Frank Sheldon, as he wiped the
grime and sweat from his face with his sleeve
and reloaded his rifle.</p>

<p>“We’ll die all right,” muttered Tom Bradford,
as his rifle cracked and accounted for another
German, “but we’ll take lots of those fellows with
us anyway.”</p>

<p>“There doesn’t seem to be any stopping them,”
grunted Billy Waldon. “Looks as if the whole
German army’s wading into us.”</p>

<p>“Heinie’s there with the goods all right,” admitted
Frank, “but it’s his last kick. He’s about
due to pass out now. We’ve got his number.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that,” cautioned Tom.
“It’s still a long, long way to the Rhine.”</p>

<p>“Stop your chinning, you fellows,” warned
Billy. “Here comes another rush. Stand fast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Down over the slightly sloping ground came
a great wave that threatened to engulf the little
band of army boys who were holding the position.</p>

<p>A hail of bullets and of hand grenades met the
assailants and tore great gaps in their lines. Men
by the score threw up their hands and fell, but
their comrades pressed on over them in a fierce
determination to wipe out once for all the American
detachment that had been holding them so
obstinately at that point of the long battle line on
the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>“They’re gluttons for punishment,” panted
Tom, as he pumped bullets into the oncoming
ranks until his gun grew hot in his hands.</p>

<p>“It’ll be hand to hand this time,” gritted Frank
between his teeth. “Bullets won’t stop them.
We’ll have to give them the bayonet.”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” growled Bart, as his fingers
tightened on his gun stock and his muscles tightened.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” muttered Billy. “I’m tired of
lying here and holding them back. I’m aching to
get into the middle of that bunch and give them a
taste of cold steel.”</p>

<p>“They’re twice as many as we are,” observed
Frank, “but that’s just about right. One American
ought to be able to handle two Huns and give
them all that’s coming to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>On came the enemy until they were so close
that the boys could see from the marks they bore
that they belonged to the Prussian guards, the
choice troops of the German army.</p>

<p>“Tough nuts to crack,” muttered Tom, “but
we’ve cracked them before and we’ll do it again.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer that mass of field gray came
until the boys could literally see the whites of
their eyes.</p>

<p>But it was no part of the American plan to
take that shock standing still and give the enemy
all the benefit of the momentum. A bugle rang
out with a call that the boys well knew and that
thrilled them to the marrow. Then down the
line came the sharp, quick command:</p>

<p>“Fix bayonet. Ready. Charge!”</p>

<p>The American boys swarmed out of the
trenches and with a shout rushed forward to
meet the foe.</p>

<p>The two forces met with a tremendous shock
that seemed at first as if it would annihilate them
both. The impact was terrific. The Germans
had the advantage of a greater momentum, but
this was offset to some extent by the fact that
they were more tired by their exertions while the
Americans were comparatively fresh.</p>

<p>There was very little firing done now. The
machine guns on either side had ceased, as they
were as likely to mow down their own men as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
enemy by shooting into that dense mass. Rifles
and revolvers were used until their charges were
exhausted. Then revolvers were thrown aside
or hurled into opponents’ faces, the rifles were
used as a backing for the bayonet or whirled
about the head like a flail, and the fighting became
a conflict between individual men or groups
battling to the death.</p>

<p>For a few minutes it was a mêlée of hacking,
clubbing and stabbing. Men by the dozen went
down, killed or wounded. Some of the latter,
who could still move, crawled or fell into shell
holes that offered some slight measure of protection.
Often a pair of combatants went down together,
locked in a close embrace from which
neither of them rose again.</p>

<p>Frank found himself engaged with two husky
Germans who attacked him at the same moment.
He side-stepped one and drove his bayonet
through the shoulder of the other. He tried to
withdraw it, but could not pull it out before the
other German was again upon him.</p>

<p>Like lightning he dropped his hold on his gun,
his fist shot out and landed flush on his assailant’s
jaw. The man went down, and Frank, content
with having put him out of action, wrenched
his gun free from his other fallen enemy and
hurried to the help of Tom, who was hard beset.</p>

<p>Whirling his gun about his head, he cleared a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
space about himself and his panting comrade. A
moment’s respite and again they plunged into the
thick of the fight.</p>

<p>“Hot stuff, eh?” said Tom, with a twisted grin
on his lips that had been cut by a glancing bayonet
thrust.</p>

<p>“Hot’s the right word,” gasped Frank.
“Where are Bart and Billy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Tom, and then, as a
group of Germans surged in upon them, they said
no more but went at it tooth and nail.</p>

<p>It was not an easy victory, for the Germans
fought desperately. But victory at last it proved
to be, as the Yankee boys pressed forward with
that same splendid get-there-or-die spirit that
they had shown ever since the first glorious days
at Belleau Wood and Château Thierry. Soon
the long lines broke up into separate groups and
a few minutes later the Germans began to retreat,
slowly at first and then more rapidly, until
the wood in front of the old Thirty-seventh had
been cleared, and the American line had been advanced
far beyond where it had been when the
fighting had begun.</p>

<p>The Americans had lost a considerable number
of men, but not so many as the enemy, for
the ground was covered with German dead.</p>

<p>Frank had come through unscathed, except for
a slight ridge in the scalp that a bullet had barely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
grazed, but Tom’s cut lip had swelled so that his
mouth was twisted in a ludicrous shape and he
could only speak with difficulty. At any other
time Frank would have been inclined to “guy”
him over the comical appearance he presented,
but now, as always after a hot fight, his first
thought was of Bart and Billy. He looked about
him anxiously, but could see nothing of them as
his glance darted in and out among the trees.</p>

<p>“Could anything have happened to the old
scouts, do you think?” he asked of Tom.</p>

<p>“They’ll turn up all right,” answered Tom,
with more confidence than he really felt.
“There’s Billy now,” he exclaimed with great relief,
pointing to the right, “and I’m blessed if the
old boy isn’t driving a couple of Huns in front
of him.”</p>

<p>It was Billy, sure enough, as jaunty and chipper
as ever, walking behind two Germans who
shuffled along sullenly enough. Billy’s face broke
into a broad grin as his friends hurried toward
him.</p>

<p>“Some class to this child,” he chuckled, as he
indicated the prisoners. “Copped them out all
by my lonesome. But where’s Bart?” he asked,
his tone changing as he noticed the absence of his
comrade.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we want to know,” replied
Frank with great uneasiness. “He got away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
us in the early part of the fighting and we haven’t
seen him since.”</p>

<p>Billy signaled to Fred Anderson, who was
passing.</p>

<p>“Take these fellows back to the pen, will you,
Fred?” he asked. “I want to help the boys hunt
up Raymond.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” responded Fred good-naturedly,
as he relieved Billy of his charges.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Billy, “let’s get a hustle on and
hunt among the wounded.”</p>

<p>Each of them felt in his heart an awful fear
that something worse than wounds might have
come to Bart, but by common consent they kept
the word “dead” away from their lips and tried
to keep it away from their minds. All of them
had been face to face with death again and again
and had been wounded more or less severely, but
so far death had spared them and the four had
grown to feel that they would all pull through
safely. But Bart was missing. Had a break
come at last?</p>

<p>Already burial parties were going up and down
the field and the stretcher parties were gathering
up the wounded to convey them to the advanced
dressing stations. The three chums attached
themselves to these and searched frantically
among both the wounded and the dead.</p>

<p>For some time their search was unavailing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and then suddenly Frank gave a call that brought
the others instantly to his side.</p>

<p>“I’ve found him!” he cried. “But I don’t
know whether he’s living or dead. Help me to
get him out of this pile of bodies.”</p>

<p>In a moment their sinewy hands had extricated
their comrade, and Frank knelt down and lifted
Bart’s head in his arms, while Tom tore open
their chum’s shirt and put his hand on his heart.</p>

<p>There was a great gash in Bart’s forehead
from which the blood had flowed freely. His
face was as pale as chalk except where it was
streaked with blood, his eyes were closed and he
showed no sign of life. But just as Frank was
fearing the worst, Tom gave an exclamation of
relief.</p>

<p>“He’s alive,” he cried. “His heart is beating.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” exclaimed Frank fervently and
was echoed by Billy. “But I’m afraid he’s pretty
badly hurt. We’ve got to get him to the hospital
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>He called out to a couple of litter bearers and
they hurried toward him. With infinite care and
tenderness they lifted Bart and put him on the
stretcher. They would have taken him to the
hospital themselves, but that was the work of the
bearers, and duty held the boys to the line that
might at any moment be assailed by the Germans
in a counter-attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Good old Bart!” murmured Frank. “He’s
alive anyway and while there’s life there’s hope.”</p>

<p>“Bart’s luck will stand by him, all right,”
prophesied Billy, reassuringly. “But that was a
fearful swipe he had across his forehead. It
must have been made by a bayonet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Tom, who had been
looking about him. “See that stump? It’s covered
with blood. Bart stumbled over a body or
something and struck his head against this stump
and it’s knocked him out.”</p>

<p>Further conjectures were deferred by a sharp,
quick summons for the men to get back into line.
An aviator had signaled that the Huns were
again preparing to attack with fresh regiments
that had been hastily brought up, and the old
Thirty-seventh, like the veterans they had become,
hurriedly consolidated their positions and
awaited the worst that the enemy could bring
against them.</p>

<p>Just then there was a stir in the lines and a
staff officer, in the uniform of a colonel, came
galloping up, attended by an orderly. He dismounted,
threw the reins to the orderly and came
up to a group of the Thirty-seventh’s officers.</p>

<p>“Who is in command here?” he asked
briskly.</p>

<p>Major Willis, who had charge of that portion
of the line, stepped forward and saluted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“I am,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Orders from headquarters,” said the newcomer,
as he returned the salute. “You are to
retire from this position at once and fall back to
your former line of defense. The enemy has
been so strongly reinforced that it is inadvisable
to remain where you are.”</p>

<p>The major looked his surprise and seemed
about to protest, but instinctively discipline asserted
itself and he again saluted and turned to
give the necessary orders.</p>

<p>The boys had been standing near enough to
hear the conversation, and Frank, happening to
catch sight of Tom’s face, was startled. His face
was pale and his eyes were blazing.</p>

<p>“What is it, Tom?” he asked in a low voice
and put his hand on his comrade’s arm.</p>

<p>But Tom shook off his hand and sprang forward.
His voice rang out like a trumpet.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” he shouted. “That man is a German
spy! Seize him! Seize him!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>TRAPPED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> effect of Tom’s words was electric.</p>

<p>It was unexampled. It was a flagrant breach
of discipline that under ordinary circumstances
would be unforgivable. A non-commissioned
officer sprang forward to thrust him back into
the ranks. But the major, after a lightning
glance at Tom and then at the strange officer, intervened.</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” he said. “Bradford, come
here.”</p>

<p>Tom stepped up in front of the major and saluted.</p>

<p>The newcomer here made a protest. His face
had flushed a fiery red when Tom had shouted
his accusation. Then he became as white as
chalk. But he pulled himself together and took
on an air of assurance.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Major,” he said arrogantly,
“the discipline in your command is deplorable.
Kindly send this young madman to the guardhouse
and obey the order I gave you. You disobey
it on your peril.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>He turned as though to mount his horse, but
Frank was too quick for him. Like a flash he
tore the reins from the orderly and held them.
The strange officer made as though he would
snatch them from him.</p>

<p>“Stop!” ordered Major Willis. “Sergeant,”
he went on, addressing a non-commissioned officer,
“stand ready with a squad of men. Take
that orderly into custody and surround this officer.
Now, Bradford,” he went on turning to
Tom, “what made you say what you did?”</p>

<p>“Because it is true, sir,” replied Tom. “That
man is an officer in the German army. I saw
him when he was wearing a German uniform in
the German lines and plotting with an American
traitor.”</p>

<p>There was a stir in the group, and the accused
man gave a start that was not lost on the major,
who was watching him intently.</p>

<p>“That is a serious accusation—a terrible accusation,”
said the major gravely. “If it is true,
it means death to this man. If it is false, it
means severe punishment for you. Are you sure
of your facts?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly sure, sir,” affirmed Tom. “It was
after I had been captured by the Germans and
was trying to escape. I was hiding up a tree in
the woods. Rabig—you know Rabig, sir, the
man we’re holding for court-martial?”—the major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
nodded—“Rabig came into the woods and sat
down under the tree I was hiding in. This man”—pointing
to the accused—“met him there and
they talked for a long time together. Money
passed between them. Then this man went away
and I dropped down on Rabig, overpowered him,
took away the pass the German had given him—and
got back to our own lines.”</p>

<p>The alleged German here interposed.</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” he exclaimed, “that you attach
any weight to a mere resemblance, admitting that
this fellow is telling what he believes to be true?
There may be a thousand men in either army that
look like me. Let us have done with this nonsense.”</p>

<p>There seemed some force in this and the major
looked inquiringly at Tom.</p>

<p>“There’s no mistake, sir,” persisted Tom. “I’d
know his face among a thousand. But there’s one
thing that will prove I’m right and that even he
himself can’t deny. The man who was talking
to Rabig had the end of the third finger missing
from his left hand.”</p>

<p>Every eye went to the stranger’s left hand. It
was encased in a riding glove and there was
nothing to indicate that it was maimed.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly remove your glove?” asked
the major with ominous politeness.</p>

<p>“I refuse,” objected the strange officer hotly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
“This is an indignity. I shall report these proceedings
at headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Remove your glove,” demanded the major
sternly, and at the same time the sergeant and his
detachment crowded about the accused, ready for
instant action.</p>

<p>There was no help for it and the officer obeyed.
<i>The first joint of the third finger of the hand was
missing.</i></p>

<p>A shout went up, increasing to a roar, as the
detected spy made a sudden dash through the
guard surrounding him, reached his horse, and
with surprising agility vaulted upon his back and
dug his spurs into his sides.</p>

<p>The horse reared high in the air with sudden
fright and pain, and started to run, dragging
Frank with him. The latter had been startled by
the unexpected action of the spy, but he held on
to the reins with desperation and refused to be
shaken off.</p>

<p>The spy drew a pistol from his belt and fired
pointblank at Frank, the bullet grazing his ear.
But he still hung on, and a moment later a score
of his comrades had caught up to them and
dragged the German from the horse’s back.</p>

<p>He fought desperately, for he knew that he
was fighting for his life, and considerable force
was necessary to subdue him. He was a sadly
battered object when at last he was half dragged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
half carried into the presence of the major and
other officers.</p>

<p>The major looked at him, and his eyes had the
glint of steel.</p>

<p>“So this is the way you play the game of war,”
he said, in tones of biting irony. “Is there anything
to which your country will not stoop?”</p>

<p>The prisoner looked at him sullenly but made
no reply.</p>

<p>“Take him away,” the major directed. “A
court-martial will attend to his case before sundown.”</p>

<p>The man was marched off, accompanied by
his orderly who had also been secured, and as he
passed Tom he favored him with a glance that
was full of venom and malignity.</p>

<p>The major turned to Tom.</p>

<p>“You have done well, Bradford,” he said, “and
you deserve the thanks of the regiment. Had
that man’s trick succeeded it might have led to a
serious situation. I will see that your name is
mentioned in the order of the day. You can return
to your place.”</p>

<p>Tom saluted and retired, and a murmur of approbation
went up from the men as he passed
them.</p>

<p>Quick orders passed down the line, for now
that the trick had failed an enemy attack could be
expected at any moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Good stuff, Tom!” exclaimed Frank approvingly
as he clapped his comrade on the shoulder.
“You were Johnny-on-the-spot that time for
fair.”</p>

<p>“You were the real goods, old boy,” agreed
Billy. “My heart was in my mouth for fear you
might have made a mistake. And it’s mighty
lucky that Frank had those reins, or the fellow
might have got away after all.”</p>

<p>“Not a chance,” replied Frank lightly. “A
dozen bullets would have got him anyway. The
game was up with him the minute he had to take
off his glove.”</p>

<p>“It was a regular Hun trick,” said Tom disdainfully.</p>

<p>“And he nearly got away with it,” commented
Billy. “He nearly had the major going. Why,
he spoke English just as well as I do.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t saying much,” chaffed Frank, and
dodged the pass that Billy made at him.</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t put it over, and a miss is as
good as a mile,” remarked Tom.</p>

<p>“Did you see the look he shot at you as he went
past?” said Billy. “If looks could kill you’d have
died on the spot.”</p>

<p>“There go the guns,” interrupted Frank, as the
enemy artillery opened up in chorus with a roar
that shook the ground, and a storm of shells
came shrieking toward them. “They’re getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
ready to charge and the guns are laying down a
barrage. We’ll have another hack at them soon.”</p>

<p>They crouched lower and clutched their rifles
tightly. And while these fearless young Americans
are waiting for the onset, it may be well, for
the sake of those who have not read the preceding
books in this series, to tell who Frank and his
comrades were and what they had been doing up
to the time our story opens.</p>

<p>Frank Sheldon was a stalwart young American
who had been born and reared in Camport, a
prosperous city of about twenty-five thousand inhabitants.
He was a bright, likable fellow, a
leader in athletic sports and a general favorite.
Above all he was a hundred per cent. American.
His father had died some years before our story
opens, and Frank was the only son and support
of his mother to whom he was devotedly attached.
She was a French woman whom Mr.
Sheldon had married while on a business visit to
France. She was the heiress to a considerable
estate left by her father, but on account of the
war had not been able to go to France to claim
the property, the settlement of which had been
held up by some legal complications.</p>

<p>Frank had secured a good position with the
firm of Moore and Thomas, and had excellent
prospects for the future when the war broke out.
His blood was on fire at once and he was eager<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to enlist, although for a time he was held back because
of his mother’s dependence on him. An
insult to the flag, however, which Frank promptly
avenged by knocking down the guilty German,
decided him, and he joined the old Thirty-seventh,
the local regiment that had already seen
service in other wars. With him enlisted his
special chum, Bart Raymond, who was as ardent
a patriot as Frank himself. Billy Waldon, another
close friend, was already a member. Tom
Bradford wanted to join, but was rejected on account
of his teeth, though afterward he was
accepted in the draft, and the four friends to
their great delight found themselves together.</p>

<p>The only discordant element was Nick Rabig,
born in America but of German parents, who had
been with them in the same firm in Camport, and
had made himself thoroughly disliked because of
his bullying disposition and pro-German sentiments.
He and Frank had been more than once
on the point of blows, and finally, after Rabig
had been caught in the draft and placed in the
Thirty-seventh, Frank gave him the thrashing
that he richly deserved.</p>

<p>How the Army Boys went through their period
of training; how they sailed for Europe and
narrowly escaped being torpedoed by a submarine,
what exciting adventures they met with in
their first contact with the enemy—these things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
are told in the first volume of this series, entitled:
“Army Boys in France; Or, From Training
Camp to Trenches.”</p>

<p>Once in the battle zone, thrilling experiences
came thick and fast. The boys were not confined
in their activities to the trenches, for the
operations soon developed into open fighting.
They were caught in a swirl of the fighting, pursued
by Uhlan cavalry, compelled to leap from a
broken bridge and finally captured by the Germans.
From this captivity they were rescued by
their aviator friend, Dick Lever, and carried back
to their lines in his aeroplane. Frank had some
encouraging news about his mother’s property
from a Colonel Pavet whose life he had saved on
the battlefield. How rapidly the boys developed
into veteran soldiers is told in the second volume
of the series, entitled: “Army Boys in the French
Trenches; Or, Hand to Hand Fights with the
Enemy.”</p>

<p>The great German drive was now preparing
and the enemy in his first successes drove the
Allies back and threatened to seize Paris and the
Channel Ports. The old Thirty-seventh was
thrown into the breach with the other American
forces and did valiant work in holding the Germans
back. Tom was captured and had a series
of stirring adventures before he rejoined his comrades.
Nick Rabig, who had been under suspicion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
from the start, was unmasked as a traitor.
The boys had many hairbreadth escapes in desperate
fighting, as will be seen from the third
volume of the series, entitled: “Army Boys on
the Firing Line; Or, Holding Back the German
Drive.”</p>

<p>The great counter-attack of Marshal Foch in
July, 1918, put an end to the enemy attempt to
advance and sealed the doom of Germany. After
that time the Huns were steadily on the retreat,
although they still put up some bitter battles.
Frank and his comrades were in the front rank of
the jubilant American army that was helping to
drive the enemy back to the Rhine. In the battle
of St. Mihiel, the Army Boys did their full share
of the fighting. By an unfortunate chain of circumstances,
Frank for a time seemed to be mixed
up with the robbery of a paymaster’s messenger,
but he was triumphantly cleared of the charge and
Nick Rabig was discovered to be the real culprit.
The story of the part the Army Boys played in
the beating of the Huns is narrated in the fourth
volume of the series, entitled, “Army Boys in the
Big Drive; Or, Smashing Forward to Victory.”</p>

<p>The artillery fire that was searching out the
American positions increased in intensity, and indicated
that the attack when it did come would be
a determined one.</p>

<p>“Fritz is sore,” remarked Tom grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Yes,” chuckled Billy, “he’s peeved because his
little game didn’t work. He had it all framed
up that he was going to get this position for nothing
and now he finds he’ll have to fight for it.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a lovely scrap,” said Frank,
peering through a chink in the log barricade that
they had erected in consolidating their position.
“I only wish that poor Bart could be here to
share it with us. That boy would rather fight
any time than eat.”</p>

<p>“Maybe some of us will be with Bart sooner
than he will be with us,” muttered Tom, who,
though he had the heart of a lion, was usually
seeing the darker side of things.</p>

<p>Just then a shell came screaming through the
air and dropped on the ground within ten feet of
them.</p>

<p>“Duck!” cried Billy, and like a flash they all
threw themselves flat on the ground, turning their
helmets in the direction of the shell to give their
heads as much protection as possible.</p>

<p>But the explosion they had nerved themselves
to hear did not take place, and after a few seconds
they raised their heads and looked curiously
in its direction.</p>

<p>The shell lay harmlessly imbedded in the earth.
From some defect, it had failed to explode.</p>

<p>The boys scrambled to their feet and looked
rather sheepishly at each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“A dud!” exclaimed Tom in profound disgust
and yet with a certain measure of relief.</p>

<p>“A false alarm,” remarked Billy as he brushed
the dirt from his uniform.</p>

<p>“It put one over on us that time for fair,” admitted
Frank, as he picked up his rifle. “But
it’s a good sign, fellows. It shows the Heinies
are running short of good powder and they have
to use an inferior brand. You can bet that there
aren’t very many of our shells that don’t explode
when they fall into their lines.”</p>

<p>“Here they come,” warned Billy. “Gee, but
those lines are thick! They’re putting all their
eggs in one basket this time.”</p>

<p>“The more that come the more to fall,” muttered
Frank, the light of battle coming into his
eyes.</p>

<p>It seemed indeed as though the Germans were
staking all the day’s results on a single throw,
for they were in much greater force than before
and they fell on the American lines like an avalanche.
It was a form of fighting in which they
were especially proficient and against weaker
fighters they might have prevailed. But the old
Thirty-seventh and the regiments to the right and
left of it had met these men before and beaten
them, had beaten them that very day, had seen
their backs, and in their hearts they knew that
they were their masters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>So that when the attack came it beat upon
granite. A withering fire from machine guns
tore through their ranks, and then from the rifles
of the Americans, many of whom wore marksmen’s
medals, leaped a sheet of flame that was the
very blast of death.</p>

<p>The thick enemy lines wavered, broke and retreated.
But under the urging and revolvers of
their officers they formed again and came on only
once more to be driven back with tremendous
losses. This time they broke utterly and fled.</p>

<p>The American officers saw their opportunity
and gave the order to charge. Over their log
shelter with a cheer went the American boys, and
pursued the beaten enemy, gathering up prisoners
as they went along. The rout was complete, and
only ended when the enemy reached and crossed
a canal which was in their rear. They blew up
the bridges after they had crossed and there for a
time the American pursuit came to an end.</p>

<p>“Gee, but this has been some day!” panted
Frank happily, after it was all over and the regiment
was resting after its well-earned victory.</p>

<p>“This is the end of a perfect day,” hummed
Billy.</p>

<p>“The biggest day the old Thirty-seventh has
had yet,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“There’s just one thing lacking,” said Frank,
“and that is that Bart isn’t with us. I’m going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
to try to get leave the first thing in the morning
and get over to the hospital.”</p>

<p>Just then Corporal Wilson, whom they knew
well, came up to them.</p>

<p>“Been to mess yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” grinned Billy, “and what we did
to that chow was a sin and a shame.”</p>

<p>The corporal smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” he said. “I’m looking for a
few volunteers. And when I say volunteers you
fellows know that the work I have in mind is
dangerous, so dangerous in fact that I wouldn’t
feel justified in ordering men to do it.”</p>

<p>All three sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>“Bring on your job,” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Trot it out,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Count me in,” added Tom.</p>

<p>Warm approval shone in Wilson’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think I’d have to look much farther,”
he said. “I’ve been on scouting trips with you
fellows before and there’s nobody I’d rather have
at my back if it came to a scrap. Go and get
your black scouting suits and blacken your faces
too. It’s going to be a black night but we can’t
take too many precautions. When you’re ready,
report to me and I’ll give you your instructions.
Of course I’m going with you.”</p>

<p>He passed on and the boys looked at each
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Wonder what the corp has on his mind?” remarked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Something risky you can bet,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, you have to hand it to Wilson,” observed
Tom. “You notice he said he was going
with us. He doesn’t ask anyone to go where he
won’t go himself.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they had donned their scout
suits and blackened their faces and reported to
the corporal. They found him at his quarters
dressed like themselves. By this time it was
fully dark and time to start.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A BREATHLESS MOMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We’re</span> going to try to cross that canal
yonder,” the corporal explained. “Headquarters
wants to learn something about the disposition of
the German forces. If what we find out suits
our officers, they may throw pontoons across and
attack. If you ask me how we’re going to get
across tonight, I tell you frankly I don’t know.
Perhaps we’ll have to swim. We’ll have to trust
to luck and our own wits. Are you ready? Then
come along.”</p>

<p>He led the way and they trailed after him like
so many shadows into the night.</p>

<p>There was no special reason for silence just
yet, as the Army Boys followed their leader, for
there were no Germans except wounded and
prisoners left on this side of the canal, and they
conversed freely among themselves, although instinctively
in low tones.</p>

<p>“If Bart were only with us!” said Frank regretfully.
“We’ve never yet gone on a trip of
this kind that that boy hasn’t been along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“He’ll be kicking himself for having missed
it,” prophesied Billy.</p>

<p>“There promises to be excitement enough in
this to satisfy even Bart,” added Tom.</p>

<p>They soon passed through the last line of sentries
and reached the bank of the canal, or river,
being partly natural and partly artificial. It was
quite a wide watercourse and there was a fringe
of trees that bordered it back of the towpath and
the boys kept close in the shadow of these. But
they no longer stood erect, for they feared that
some light from the camp might form a background
against which their figures could be seen.
Down they went on hands and knees and crept
along with the stealth of so many Indians out
on a night foray.</p>

<p>Across the canal they could see a long and irregular
glow which came from the dugouts and
trenches where the Germans had established
themselves. The line was at some distance from
the canal itself, but they did not doubt that sentries
were established along the whole bank on
the lookout for just such a venture as the boys
were engaged in.</p>

<p>“The corp was right in calling for volunteers,”
whispered Frank in Billy’s ear.</p>

<p>“Looks to me like the riskiest thing we’ve been
in yet,” returned Billy.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to do some classy swimming to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
over without making a splash,” grunted Tom.</p>

<p>For half a mile or more they kept on down the
canal, until they got beyond the zone of light and
felt it safe to rise and emerge from the woods,
cross the towpath, and reach the very edge of the
bank.</p>

<p>In some places the bank went down straight
into the water, and they could not drop in without
making a noise. In others, however, it
shelved somewhat, and these Wilson explored
with the greatest care.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped and beckoned the boys to
come nearer. They gathered about him.</p>

<p>“Look at this,” he whispered, and they saw
that he had his hand on the stern of a small boat
that had been drawn in the shelter of a little arch
at the side of the canal.</p>

<p>“Just what the doctor ordered,” commented
Frank, as he saw that the boat was big enough
to carry four on a pinch and could faintly see the
outline of a pair of oars lying across the thwarts.</p>

<p>“It beats swimming,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“Get into it,” ordered Wilson. “No, don’t do
that,” he said hastily, as Billy was about to take
up one of the oars. “I’m afraid they’ll hear us if
we use the oars. We’ll just push it across with
our hands. It’s slower but it’s safer.”</p>

<p>They slipped into the boat as silently as ghosts,
and dipping their hands in the water with the utmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
caution began to propel the craft towards
the further bank.</p>

<p>The boat was a homemade affair, probably
built by some peasant, and was heavy and clumsy.
Moreover, with the four it was forced low in the
water and moved with difficulty. But there was
plenty of time, for they had the greater part of
the night before them.</p>

<p>Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the boat progressed.
No shot greeted it, no hail from the
shore told that it was discovered. The silence
was almost uncanny.</p>

<p>On they went until at last the further bank
loomed up before them. Soon they were near
enough to touch it with their hands. But it was
smooth and steep and they could not reach the
top.</p>

<p>They worked their way along the wall, until
finally they came to a place where several stones
had fallen out, so that the holes left by them
served as holds for their hands and feet. At a
whispered command from the corporal, Frank
worked his way up until his eyes were on a level
with the top of the bank. There he stood and
looked and listened with every faculty intent.</p>

<p>“Nothing stirring,” he reported, as he let himself
down again in the boat. “Either the Germans
haven’t strung their lines down this far or
they’re lying mighty low. I think it’s worth taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
a chance to land here. There’s a patch of
woods a hundred yards or so away, and if we can
reach that we can take our bearings and decide
on what we’ll do next.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the corporal after a moment’s
consideration. “I’ll chance it on your judgment,
Sheldon. We’ll leave the boat here and Bradford
with it.”</p>

<p>Tom made a move to protest, but discipline asserted
itself and he resigned himself without a
word, although sorely disappointed at not being
allowed to go on with the others.</p>

<p>“The hoot of an owl will be the signal,” Wilson
told him as they prepared to leave the boat.
“When you hear that, give the answer so that we
can find our way to where you are. Have the
oars all ready, as we may have to leave in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>Tom nodded his understanding and the rest
left him, dropping flat on the bank as soon as
they reached the top and worming their way over
the space that intervened between them and the
patch of woods some distance beyond.</p>

<p>The strain on nerves and muscles was tremendous
and it was with a sigh of relief that
they reached the shelter of the woods. Here
they could rise to their feet, although even this
required the most extreme care. They were by
no means assured that it was a friendly shelter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
It might contain machine gun nests or strong
forces of the enemy.</p>

<p>Five minutes of the most intense silence and
listening passed before they dared even to whisper
to each other. Convinced at last that no one
was close at hand, the boys drew near the corporal
for his final instructions.</p>

<p>“We’re certainly in luck so far,” he breathed.
“The only explanation of the failure to have sentries
here is that they had no idea today that they
were going to be driven back so far as to have to
cross the canal. They came over helter-skelter
and they’ve been so busy in blowing up bridges
and getting their rattled forces together that
other things have had to wait. But it’s only a
matter of time before they’ll have guards set
here, and we want to get back before that happens,
if possible. Bring your watch hands close
to mine and let’s compare so as to see that we
have the same time.”</p>

<p>They did as directed, and the illumined faces
of their radio watches showed that their time was
practically the same.</p>

<p>“Five after ten,” remarked the corporal. “That
gives us two hours until midnight. At twelve
o’clock sharp, wherever you happen to be, start
back for the boat. You’ve each got a compass
and you can come pretty close to the place, and
the owl signal will do the rest. Find out whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
you can as to where the enemy has his battery
positions, where he has gathered his greatest
force, and where his wire entanglements are
weakest. You’ve got your knives, and if I were
you I’d depend on those if you find it necessary.
Only use your revolver as a last resort, for if you
have to fire the jig is up.</p>

<p>“Now we’re going to spread out like a fan.
Sheldon, you go off there to the left. Waldon
will bear a little away from the canal bank toward
the north, and I’ll take the path between you two.
I don’t need to tell you that your life depends on
your being careful. You know that as well as
I do. Twelve o’clock sharp, mind. Good-bye
and good luck.”</p>

<p>Without another word they separated, gliding
from tree to tree and gradually getting further
apart, as they followed the general path that had
been marked out for them.</p>

<p>Frank had not gone far before he had increasing
evidence that he was approaching the main
body of the enemy’s troops. The light grew
brighter that came from the hastily dug trenches
of the enemy. Groups of men passed to and fro
with lanterns, sometimes coming so close to the
sheltering woods that he had to flatten himself in
the bushes, scarcely daring to breathe until they
had passed.</p>

<p>Reaching at last the edge of the forest, he rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
to his feet behind a huge tree and peered out. He
could have shouted with delight, for he saw that
he had happened upon a spot where the enemy
was concentrating their heavy artillery. Great
guns were being moved into position, emplacements
for them were being hastily constructed,
and he was able by the lanterns that flitted in and
out among them like so many fire-flies to get a
fairly accurate idea of their number and calibre.
Here was information that would be more precious
than gold to his officers. He could take no
notes, but he went over the whole scene again
and again in his mind, so that he should forget
no detail.</p>

<p>So absorbed did he become in noting all that he
thought might be of value to his officers that
when a stream of light was thrown suddenly in
his direction it struck him with almost the force
of a blow.</p>

<p>He drew back like a flash and flattened himself
against his side of the tree, making himself as
small as possible.</p>

<p>After a minute or two he ventured to peer out.
The light which came from a searchlight which
was being tested by the enemy was darting about,
now here, now there, but evidently without any
special purpose in view, and his first fear that it
had betrayed his hiding place subsided. But another
apprehension took its place at once, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
saw a man in an officer’s uniform coming directly
toward him.</p>

<p>Frank instinctively felt for his revolver, but he
dismissed that thought before his hand touched
the butt. With enemies swarming all about him,
a shot at that moment would be little less than
suicide. But his knife was still there, and his
hand closed around its handle while his lips tightened
with resolution.</p>

<p>The officer came on and Frank crouched for a
spring in case he should be discovered. But to
his great relief, the officer paused just before he
reached the tree, drew a pipe from his pocket and
lighted it. Then with a grunt of satisfaction he
leaned up against the tree and puffed away, while
he looked at the animated scene from which he
had withdrawn for a few minutes of rest and relaxation.</p>

<p>The tobacco was vile, more like burning leaves
than anything else, and as the clouds from the
pipe enveloped Frank, he had all he could do to
keep from coughing or sneezing. But he kept
the impulse in check and waited with what patience
he could command for the officer’s next
move.</p>

<p>The searchlight was flashing in another quarter
now, for which Frank was devotedly thankful,
but there was still too much light to make it
safe for the young American to attempt to crawl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
away. He glanced at his watch and saw that it
was nearly midnight. The corporal and his
chums would be waiting for him.</p>

<p>With infinite caution he peered around the
side of the tree. Would that pipeful never be
smoked out?</p>

<p>The officer had shifted his position somewhat,
and Frank caught a glimpse of a paper protruding
from an outside pocket of his coat. It
looked like an official document of some kind.
The thought came to Frank that it might contain
some plans of the enemy for the next day’s
fighting.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous risk to attempt to get it,
but Frank resolved to take the chance.</p>

<p>Drawing his knife and holding it ready for instant
action, his other hand reached slowly
around the tree and crept toward the officer’s
pocket.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>IN THE TUNNEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Slowly</span>, so slowly that it scarcely seemed to
move, Frank’s hand advanced until the fingers
closed on the paper. Fortunately it protruded
far enough for Frank to get a good grip on it.</p>

<p>If his hand had trembled, he would have been
betrayed in an instant. But the experiences he
had been through had steeled Frank’s nerves and
his muscles worked with the precision of a machine.</p>

<p>A fraction of an inch at a time, he drew the
paper out until it was clear of the officer’s pocket.
Then he transferred it to his own. He had won.
And he was jubilant.</p>

<p>Still, he was in imminent danger. At any moment
the officer might discover his loss, think he
had dropped the paper and begin to look around
for it. That would be unlucky for Frank. But,
the young soldier thought grimly, as he gripped
his knife tightly, it might be still more unlucky
for the officer.</p>

<p>The pipe was smoked out now. The officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
tapped it against the tree to knock the ashes out
and seemed of two minds as to whether he should
refill it. He finally decided that he had stayed
there long enough, an opinion with which Frank
heartily agreed, thrust his pipe in his pocket and
started to walk away. Frank watched him with
his heart in his mouth. Would he discover his
loss?</p>

<p>The officer had gone about ten feet when
Frank saw him give a sudden start. He uttered
an exclamation in German and then felt hurriedly
in all his pockets. Then he turned and began to
retrace his steps slowly, his eyes glued to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Now I’m in for it,” thought Frank, as his
muscles stiffened.</p>

<p>But the officer came no farther than the foot of
the tree. That to his mind marked the limit of
where the paper could possibly be. He dropped
on his hands and knees and looked in the grass,
but of course to no avail. Then he rose, brushed
off his clothes and muttering harshly to himself
he strode off in the direction of the camp, searching
every foot of the way as he went along.
There was a bad quarter of an hour in store for
him when he should have to confess the loss of
the paper to his superior officer.</p>

<p>Frank only waited until the officer was at a
safe distance. Then he wound his way on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
hands and knees through underbrush until he was
well beyond the zone of light of the camp. Only
then did he rise to his feet and slipping from one
tree to another hurried in the direction where his
compass told him he would find the boat.</p>

<p>When he reached the line of trees that bordered
the canal, he paused and gave the hoot of
an owl. A moment later, there was an answering
call that enabled him to locate the boat’s position.
He made his way to the bank and looking
over saw the dark outline of the boat.</p>

<p>“Are you there, Tom?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I’m here all right,” came Tom’s voice in answer.
“Tumble in.”</p>

<p>In a jiffy, Frank had let himself down in the
boat and grasped his friend’s hand.</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad you’re back,” whispered
Tom, in great relief. “I began to fear the Huns
had got you. Any luck?”</p>

<p>“I got a pretty good line on some things that
our officers want to know,” replied Frank, “and
I’ve got a paper in my pocket that may be worth
something. The fellow that lost it seemed to
think it was important, judging from the frantic
way he was looking for it. You didn’t think
that your old friend would ever turn pickpocket,
did you?”</p>

<p>He told his story in whispers, and Tom
chuckled as he listened to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Good work, old man,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“But what’s keeping Billy and the corporal?”
asked Frank anxiously. “It’s getting on toward
one o’clock.”</p>

<p>Just then the owl call came, and a moment later
the corporal dropped cautiously down into the
waiting boat.</p>

<p>“Anything doing?” was the first question he
asked of Tom after greetings had been exchanged.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” answered Tom. “I heard a
patrol going along the road about an hour ago,
and later on I heard the stroke of oars. But it
was too dark for me to see anything.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when a volley of shots
rang out. There were hoarse shouts and the
sound of running feet. Then along came Billy,
panting and breathless.</p>

<p>“The Huns!” he gasped, as he dropped into
the boat. “They nearly got me and they’re close
behind. We’ll have to make a quick get-away or
they’ll nab us.”</p>

<p>“Quick!” ordered the corporal. “Sheldon, you
take one oar and Bradford the other. Pull for
the other side as fast as you can. Don’t splash
any more than you can help, or we’ll be a mark
for the Huns’ bullets. Quick now!”</p>

<p>The boys needed no urging, for the sounds told
them that their foe had almost reached the bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
of the canal. They bent to the oars and the boat
shot away from the shore. But they had scarcely
taken three strokes before a star shell rose from
the enemy side of the canal and shed a greenish
ghastly radiance over the scene. By its light,
they saw a dozen or more Germans on the bank
they had just left, and a volley of bullets that
came singing over their heads and about the boat
told them that they offered a good target.</p>

<p>But it was not this group of enemies that gave
them the greatest concern. A more serious peril
threatened them. For in that green flare of the
star shell they saw two boats between them and
the shore they sought. And the guttural shouts
that had come from these boats at their discovery
told the Americans that the occupants were Germans.</p>

<p>They grasped the situation at once. These
were the boats whose oar strokes had been heard
by Tom. There were half a dozen men in each
boat and their errand on the American side had
been the same as that of the Army Boys among
the Germans.</p>

<p>It was a time for quick thinking, and the corporal
was equal to the emergency. His party was
outnumbered three to one by the men in the
enemy boats, to say nothing of their comrades on
the farther shore. The first star shell had faded,
but others followed in quick succession, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
there was no chance to slip between the enemy
boats in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Turn her head upstream,” ordered Wilson,
and the boat swung round.</p>

<p>“Now, pull for your lives,” the corporal commanded.
“Our only chance is to get far enough
ahead of those fellows to cut into the shore.
When you fellows are tired, Waldon and I will
take the oars. Pull, now, pull!”</p>

<p>Frank and Tom obeyed, putting every ounce
of strength into their strokes, until it seemed as
though the oars must snap. The boat sprang
forward like a live thing, while the corporal and
Billy, with their bodies concealed as much as possible,
sent shot after shot from their revolvers
at the men in the German boats.</p>

<p>The enemy had grasped the purpose of the
turning upstream, and both boats raced on, trying
to keep on a line with the Americans and prevent
them turning in to shore. At the same time,
the German patrol on the further bank ran along
the shore with a constant crackling of rifle fire.
Bullets whistled about the boat, some of them
penetrating the side. One of them went through
the corporal’s sleeve, grazing his arm and bringing
blood. Another knocked Tom’s oar from
his hand, but he recovered it in a desperate grab
before it got out of reach, and the boat kept on
with only a momentary lessening of its speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Suddenly Billy gave an exclamation of alarm
as a dark wall of what appeared to be solid rock
loomed up before them.</p>

<p>“Back water!” he shouted. “The boat will be
smashed!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” countermanded Wilson after a
quick glance. “It’s a tunnel. There’s nothing to
do but keep on. It kills our chance of getting to
the shore. But on the other hand it’s dark in
there and we may be able to double on these fellows
and give them the slip. Keep on.”</p>

<p>The boat shot quickly into the blackness of the
tunnel through which the canal flowed at that
point. The bullets ceased to sing about them.
The radiance of the star shells died away. Darkness
enfolded them, a darkness so intense that
they were absolutely hidden from each other.
They rowed along for some distance with undiminished
speed. Then as no sound of oars
was heard in pursuit, the corporal gave the word
to lay on the oars.</p>

<p>“Some race!” panted Frank as he wiped the
perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>“But we beat them to it!” gasped Tom. “Gee,
I never worked so hard in my life!”</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to be following us,” commented
Billy.</p>

<p>The corporal pulled out his flashlight and
turned it around them. They were startled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
see how the stream had narrowed after entering
the tunnel. There was barely room for two
barges to pass each other.</p>

<p>The corporal’s face was grave as he made the
discovery.</p>

<p>“No chance of doubling on them in here,” he
remarked. “Looks very much as if they’d got
us in a trap. If they follow us up, we’ll have to
fight it out. And we haven’t got too much ammunition
left. I sent most of my bullets at the
Huns in the boats.”</p>

<p>“You toppled over two of them,” said Tom.
“I saw them drop. But there’s a lot of them
left.”</p>

<p>“There’s a light at the mouth of the tunnel!”
exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>They looked back.</p>

<p>From the point that they had reached the tunnel
extended back to its mouth as straight as an
arrow, and they could see the two boats that had
been in pursuit lying beside each other, while
from the light of a lantern in the bow of one they
could see the figures of the men engaged in an
animated debate. They seemed to be divided as
to the course to pursue.</p>

<p>“Wonder if they’ll follow us in,” murmured
Tom.</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to relish the idea very
much,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“The chances are that they will,” judged the
corporal. “They know that they outnumber us,
and they won’t want to let us go back to our
lines with the information we’ve picked up.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the light went out.</p>

<p>“I wonder what that means,” said Billy anxiously.</p>

<p>“I think it means they’re coming,” replied the
corporal. “They put the light out so that they
won’t offer a mark for our revolvers. It looks as
though it might come to a battle in the dark.”</p>

<p>“If it does, I’ll match our eyes against theirs,”
remarked Frank confidently.</p>

<p>“We’ll get at the oars again,” said the corporal.
“I don’t know how long this tunnel is, but it must
end somewhere. If we can reach the outlet and
find no Germans there, we’ll have a chance to get
back to our lines by land. If not, we’ll have to
give these fellows a fight, no matter by how many
they outnumber us. I only wish we had more
ammunition. A few more shots and we’ll be
through.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got our knives anyway,” said Tom,
“and Heinie hates knife fighting at close quarters.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hand grenade,” put in Frank. “I
picked it up as we were coming away from camp,
on the chance that it might come in handy in case
we were discovered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Good work,” said the corporal approvingly.
“But now we’d better start. Waldon and I will
take the oars, so as to give you other fellows a
rest. Make as little noise as you can but work
fast.”</p>

<p>They bent to their work, quickened somewhat
by the faint sound of oars which told them that
the enemy was approaching.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>A MASTER STROKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> fresh arms at the oars, they hit up a
rapid gait, which in that unknown passage was
not without its dangers. The darkness was so
intense that they could not see a foot ahead of
them, and they dared not use the flashlight for
fear it would betray their location to their pursuers.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope this tunnel is straight all the way
through,” muttered Tom. “If there’s a winding
in it and we bring up against the sides it may send
us all to kingdom come.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” returned Frank, “but there’s
no help for it. We’ve got to take our chance.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely gotten the words out of his
mouth when what Tom had feared came to pass.
The boat smashed head on into the rocky wall
where the tunnel described a curve. There was
a grinding of oars, a splintering of planks and a
startled exclamation from the Army Boys.</p>

<p>Luckily Frank and Tom had been sitting in the
stern of the boat, and, though they were badly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
shaken, escaped the full force of the blow. Billy
and the corporal were thrown from their seats
into the bottom of the boat. The bow was
smashed in, and a great jagged hole in the side
opened the way for a flood of water that rushed
in. In a moment the boat had sunk to the
gunwales. Another moment and she had gone
under the surface and the four occupants found
themselves floundering in the water.</p>

<p>All were expert swimmers, and the ducking
meant nothing in itself. But the loss of the boat
might well mean the loss of their liberty or their
lives.</p>

<p>They swam to the rocky side nearest them and
clambered up on the bank. The path along the
canal was a narrow one and the wall of the tunnel
rose up perfectly smooth on the further side
of it, affording no opportunity of concealment.</p>

<p>The corporal gathered them around him. It
was time for quick thinking for the sound of
oars had grown plainer and the enemy would
soon be upon them.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to run for it,” Wilson whispered.
“We ought to be able to keep ahead of them until
we reach the other end of the tunnel. It would
be easy enough if we could see where we were
going, but we’ll have to feel our way and make
sure we don’t tumble into the canal. We’ve got
the chance that they may make the same mistake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
that we did and smash into the canal wall. But
then again they may know more about the way
the canal runs and steer clear of it. Come along,
now. I’ll lead the way and you fellows keep close
behind me.”</p>

<p>They started off at as rapid a pace as they
dared in the pitch blackness and soon had the
satisfaction of noting that the sound of oars had
grown fainter, thus indicating that they were
outdistancing their pursuers.</p>

<p>They had kept this up for perhaps ten minutes
when they caught sight of something that
seemed like a star in the distance. But as they
drew nearer they saw that it was a fire that
had been built on the canal bank, and soon they
could detect the figures of men moving about it.</p>

<p>They stopped short for consultation.</p>

<p>“There’s a patrol of some kind there,” said the
corporal, as he strained his eyes, “and it isn’t
likely that it’s anybody we care to meet. Sheldon,
your eyes are the best. See if you can make
out those uniforms.”</p>

<p>“I think they’re Huns,” judged Frank, after a
moment’s intense scrutiny. “But we’ll have to
get a trifle closer before I can be sure of it.”</p>

<p>They moved a hundred feet closer and then
conjecture gave way to certainty.</p>

<p>“No doubt about it,” pronounced Frank.
“They’re Huns, as sure as shooting. And there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
are twenty of them if there’s one. They’re right
in our path and there’s no getting around them.”</p>

<p>It was grave news, and their pulses quickened
as they recognized their peril.</p>

<p>The corporal pondered a moment before reaching
a decision.</p>

<p>“We’re between two fires,” he said. “It would
be suicide to go forward with our numbers and
our scanty ammunition. With the fellows in the
boats we’ve still got a chance. We’ll have to
double on our tracks and try to get past the
boats. When we hear them coming close, we’ll
lie down flat on the path and trust to their passing
us without seeing us. The only thing that
will queer us will be if they happen to flash a
light when they’re abreast of us.”</p>

<p>The young soldiers followed him as he turned
and started on the return journey, listening as
they went for tokens of the enemy’s approach.</p>

<p>Soon the sound of oars grew distinct. The
corporal gave a whispered command and they
flattened themselves on the bank as far away
from the edge as possible.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the boat. They listened
in vain for the second craft. It was evident
that it was either far behind or perhaps had
been left at the mouth of the tunnel to trap them
when they should try to emerge.</p>

<p>Closer, still closer the boat came, and the Army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Boys lay like so many statues, holding their
breath lest the slightest sound should betray
them.</p>

<p>Now they knew that the boat was almost
abreast, as they could hear the labored breathing
of the men tugging at the oars.</p>

<p>But just then the leader of the Huns turned a
flashlight in their direction, revealing the four
figures. There was a shout, a sharp command in
guttural tones, a dropping of oars and a click of
rifles as the men raised them to their shoulders.</p>

<p>But quick as they were, Frank was quicker.</p>

<p>Lithe as a panther, he sprang to his feet and
hurled the grenade that he had been holding in
his hand full at the boat.</p>

<p>There was a blinding flash, a terrific explosion
and the air was filled with flying bodies and
debris. Frank himself was thrown to the ground
by the shock, but scrambled to his feet again,
none the worse except for a few bruises.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see the effects of the explosion,
but the dead silence that followed told
its own story. There was nothing more to be
feared from that special group of enemies.</p>

<p>His own comrades gathered around Frank,
themselves too dazed and shaken by the suddenness
of the whole affair to understand fully just
what had happened.</p>

<p>“What did it?” asked Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“That was the grenade I was telling you fellows
about a few minutes ago,” replied Frank.
“I thought of it again just when I dropped to
the ground. I figured that I might have a chance
to smash their boat with it, so I got it out and
had it ready in my hand.”</p>

<p>“Great stuff, Sheldon,” said the corporal
warmly. “It did the work all right. It’s lucky
we only had one boat to deal with. But now
we’ve got to make tracks for the mouth of the
tunnel.”</p>

<p>“And we can’t do it any too quick either,” said
Tom, as the sound of a commotion rose behind
them. “Those fellows round that fire have heard
that explosion and they’ll be coming on the double
quick to see what’s up.”</p>

<p>There was a growing din behind them that
hastened their steps as they hurried along. Once,
Billy going too near the edge nearly fell into the
canal, from which he was saved by Tom’s quick
grab of his arm. At intervals the corporal used
his flashlight on the narrow road ahead of him
but he did not dare to do it very often, for fear
that the light might be seen by Huns who might
be lying in wait at the tunnel’s mouth.</p>

<p>Soon they were conscious from the increasing
freshness of the air that they were nearing the
entrance. They slackened their steps a little, for
the noise in the rear had died down. They did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
not interpret this as meaning that their adversaries
had given up the chase, but thought it
more likely that they had halted at the scene of
the explosion to try to fathom its meaning.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the corporal, when they were
within a few yards of the entrance, “I’m going
to scout ahead and see whether that other boat
is hanging about. If it isn’t we’ll have an easy
time in swimming to the bank. If it is, we’ll
have some fighting before we win out.”</p>

<p>He stole away like an Indian, but almost before
the boys realized that he had gone he was
back again.</p>

<p>“They’re out there all right,” he reported.
“The boat is lying about twenty feet from the
mouth. I couldn’t see it, but I located it from
some low talking that was going on. There’s
nothing to do but make a sudden dash, catch
them unawares and get to the other side before
they recover. Now here’s how I figure we may
do it,” and he outlined his plan hurriedly while
the young Army Boys listened intently.</p>

<p>“It sounds good,” said Frank. “And there’s
another reason why we’ve got to do it anyway,”
he added, as a sound of hurrying feet behind
them told them that the Hun patrol had again
taken up the pursuit.</p>

<p>They followed the corporal to the tunnel’s
mouth. For an instant they stood there listening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
until they had located the position of the
boat.</p>

<p>“Now!” shouted Wilson.</p>

<p>Their revolvers spoke at the same moment and
there were cries from the boat that told that the
bullets had found a mark. Then they hurled
their revolvers into the mass that the light of
their shots had revealed, dived into the water, and
struck out for the further side.</p>

<p>There was a wild commotion in the boat that
had been so suddenly attacked. The inmates had
been taken totally by surprise and the confusion
was indescribable.</p>

<p>Those who had not been wounded and still retained
their wits sprang to the oars and tried to
turn the boat in the direction of the boys. Others
seized their weapons and sent a scattering
volley after the fugitives. But the shots were
fired at random and went wild, although one or
two struck the water uncomfortably close.</p>

<p>It was a case of surprise and audacity winning
out against odds. All of the Americans
could swim like fish, and as the distance to the
shore was not great, it was only a matter of two
or three minutes before they struck the bank
and clambered up its sides. A moment more and
they had crossed the path and reached the shelter
of the trees on the further side. Only then did
they pause to take breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“A close call,” gasped Frank, as he shook the
water from his face and hair.</p>

<p>“Closer than I care for,” remarked the corporal,
“but we’ve come off scot free, or at least I
hope we have. Any of you fellows wounded?”</p>

<p>“Never touched me,” grinned Billy.</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed Frank and Tom jubilantly.</p>

<p>“Good,” said the corporal. “I think our officers
will be satisfied with the night’s work.
We’ve got a lot of information, and we’ve accounted
for quite a number of Huns while we
were getting it. Now we’ll go straight to headquarters.”</p>

<p>There was no occasion for secrecy now, as they
were in their own lines, and they made good
time past the sentinels and to the section where
the old Thirty-seventh lay. Their officers were
poring over maps in earnest consultation, but
Captain Baker and Major Willis came forward
when the party appeared.</p>

<p>The corporal saluted and made his report.
Then each of the Army Boys was questioned in
turn as to his share in the night’s events. The
information they had gained was of marked
value for the coming day’s operations, but by
far the greatest importance was given to the
paper that Frank had so cleverly extracted from
the German officer’s pocket. A general laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
went round when they heard the story of how
it had been done, but amusement was soon lost
in excitement as they scanned the paper.</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Major Willis, “it’s a complete
plan of the defenses of the Jager Brigade,
the one that’s right opposite our part of the line!
The Germans would rather have lost a million
dollars than to have had that paper fall into our
hands.”</p>

<p>“The beauty of it is,” replied Captain Baker,
“that they don’t know we’ve got it. If they did,
they’d change their plan. But it’s ten to one
they’ll think it’s lying around in their own lines
somewhere and they’ll just give the officer a
reprimand for carelessness and let it go at that.”</p>

<p>“You have done very well, Sheldon,” said
Major Willis, turning to Frank. “It was an
excellent piece of work. The names of all of
you will be mentioned in the order of the day and
there may be other rewards in store for you.
You made no mistake, Corporal, in picking out
your men,” he continued, turning to Wilson.
“You were fortunate in your helpers and they
were worthy of their leader. You may go now.”</p>

<p>They saluted and retired, tired and almost exhausted
with the strain they had been under, but
happy in the commendation of their officers and
the consciousness that they had played their part
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“There’s just one thing lacking,” said Frank,
as they were getting ready to turn in, “and that
is that poor Bart wasn’t along.”</p>

<p>“Good old Bart,” said Billy regretfully. “How
he would have enjoyed that scrapping. He’ll
feel cheated when he hears of it.”</p>

<p>“That boy would rather fight than eat,” was
Tom’s tribute to their absent friend. “I’d give
a lot to know just how he’s getting along with
that broken head of his.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go over to the hospital the first thing
in the morning and find out,” said Frank, as he
rolled himself in his blankets.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>COLONEL PAVET RETURNS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> when the morning came, there was no
chance to make the intended visit, for the regiment
was shifting its position in preparation for
an attack on the enemy lines. Orders were flying
thick and fast, orderlies were riding from
one division to another, and it was evident that
a great battle was impending. Artillery was
being brought up from the rear, for the army
had gone ahead so fast on the preceding day that
they had outdistanced their guns. Tanks, too,
were massing in great numbers on the front.</p>

<p>As one of the great monsters was lumbering
by where the boys were stationed, something
went wrong with the machinery and the driver
stepped out to adjust it. An exclamation of delight
broke from the Army Boys, as they recognized
the bronzed face of their old friend, Will
Stone.</p>

<p>His pleasure at the meeting was just as great,
and his face was beaming as he came over to
them with outstretched hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“What good wind blew you up this way?”
asked Frank, after the first greetings were over.</p>

<p>“Been ordered up here to help you fellows
clean out the Argonne forest,” answered Stone
with a grin. “Some job, too, if all I hear about
the place is true.”</p>

<p>“It’s a big job, sure enough,” admitted Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ve turned the trick whenever we
tackled the Huns so far, and I guess we’re not
going to fall down on this,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bart?” asked Stone, as he glanced
about him. “I hope nothing’s happened to him.”</p>

<p>“Nothing fatal, we hope,” responded Frank
soberly. “He hit his head against a stump, in a
charge we were making yesterday morning, and
cut it badly. They took him off to the hospital
and we were figuring on going over today and
seeing how he was getting along. But I’m afraid
we can’t get off if we’re going to attack.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Stone sympathetically, “but
I don’t think we need to figure on an attack today.
They won’t be able to get things in readiness
before night. I was tipped off a little while
ago that the fight was going to start tomorrow
morning at dawn. So you may be able to see
Bart today. If you do, tell him I was asking
about him and that I’m rooting for him to get
well. But I’ll have to tinker up this machine of
mine and be getting along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>With a cordial wave of the hand he left them,
and after adjusting the machinery started off to
reach his appointed part of the line.</p>

<p>“He’s a bully good fellow,” remarked Frank
admiringly, as they gazed after him.</p>

<p>“You bet he is,” agreed Tom.</p>

<p>Stone’s prophecy proved to be correct, for late
that afternoon it was announced that the attack
would take place on the following morning. The
men were released from standing in readiness
and the Army Boys had no difficulty in getting
permission to visit their comrade.</p>

<p>But the hopes they had cherished of finding
Bart better were doomed to disappointment.
They were taken by the Red Cross nurse into the
ward in which he lay, his face flushed with fever,
his hands clenching and unclenching, while incoherent
mutterings came from his lips. It wrung
their hearts to see their chum in such a plight.</p>

<p>“What does the doctor say about him?” Frank
asked the nurse anxiously.</p>

<p>“He says that the case is very serious,” was
the reply. “He fears that it may develop into
brain fever. He said this morning that if it were
not for the splendid vitality of the patient, he
wouldn’t have a chance. As it is, he hopes he
may pull him through.”</p>

<p>The boys were shocked by this verdict. They
had been through so many adventures with Bart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
he had been such a loyal and dependable comrade,
that it seemed as though he had become a
part of themselves. Army life without Bart with
them seemed almost unthinkable.</p>

<p>“Of course,” the nurse hastened to reassure
them, as she saw their clouded faces, “it may not
prove as serious as the doctor fears. It will be
a day or two before he can predict with some
degree of certainty.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but hope, and the
boys left the hospital with downcast faces and
heavy hearts. They knew that they were carrying
a burden that would not be lightened until
Bart was once more at their side.</p>

<p>On their way back, they passed a prison pen
where a large number of Germans captured in
the previous day’s fighting were confined. Most
of these were out in the open, but there were
some small structures in the enclosure where
those who were charged with serious offenses
were imprisoned under guard of sentries who
were pacing up and down before the huts.</p>

<p>“There’s Fred Anderson,” remarked Tom.</p>

<p>“Hello, Fred,” called out Billy.</p>

<p>“How are you, Billy?” responded Fred, coming
to a pause as they drew near. “I see you
fellows are coming from the hospital. Been
over to see Bart, I suppose. How’s the old scout
getting along?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“He’s in a bad fix,” responded Frank sadly.
“The doctor doesn’t know whether he’ll pull
through or not.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said Fred with genuine regret,
for Bart was a general favorite with the
members of the Thirty-seventh. “I hope he’ll
come around all right.”</p>

<p>“We all hope that,” responded Billy. “All the
boys of the old regiment will be rooting for him.
How comes it that you’re on sentry duty, Fred?”</p>

<p>“Just my hard luck,” grumbled Fred. “Whom
do you think I’m guarding in here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some old Hun, I suppose, with an unpronounceable
name,” said Billy carelessly.</p>

<p>“Bad guess,” grinned Fred. “It’s Nick Rabig.”</p>

<p>The name acted like an electric shock on the
three comrades.</p>

<p>“Rabig!” they exclaimed in the same breath.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” said Fred. “Seems to be popular
with you fellows, I don’t think.”</p>

<p>“The yellow dog!” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>“The traitor!” growled Frank.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t they settled his case long ago?”
gritted Tom. “He ought to have been stood up
before a firing squad the day after they captured
him the last time.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he deserved all right,” agreed
Fred. “He’s the only fellow that ever disgraced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the colors of the old Thirty-seventh. The fact
is, I suppose, that we’ve been so busy chasing the
Huns out of France that a court-martial hasn’t
had time to attend to his case. But it’s a dead
open and shut case and he’ll get his all right when
the time comes.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long time coming,” grumbled Tom,
who, as our readers will remember, had especial
cause to despise the man whom he had caught in
the very act of dealing with the enemy.</p>

<p>“Well, so long, old man,” said Frank, as the
friends prepared to go on their way. “Sorry you
got stuck with guard duty. Hope your time’s
nearly up.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got half an hour at it yet,” replied Fred,
as he consulted his wrist watch and shouldered
his rifle. “I’ll be back with you then, if a Hun
shell doesn’t get me. Their batteries have been
trying to get our range, and they’re getting uncomfortably
close with their high explosives.
We’ll have to move our prisoners farther back
if they keep it up much longer.”</p>

<p>“Here comes a shell now,” exclaimed Frank,
who had learned by long experience to tell from
the whining of a shell just about where it was
going to land. “Down, fellows, quick!”</p>

<p>They dropped flat on the ground and none too
soon to escape a huge shell that flew over their
heads and exploded just beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>But if it had missed them, another had not
been so fortunate. The shell had struck the hut
that Fred had been guarding and reduced it to
atoms. It had missed Fred himself by only a
matter of feet, and as he had followed the example
of his friends and thrown himself to the
ground he was unharmed.</p>

<p>As the boys rose to their feet and looked
around them, they saw what had happened and
ran to the remains of the hut. They looked inside
and then turned away. That one glance had
been enough to tell them what had become of
Rabig. He had gone to his last account, and
there was no further need of any earthly court
to judge his deeds and fix his punishment.</p>

<p>“And it was the very people to whom he sold
out that killed him,” mused Frank, as the remains
of the dead traitor were gathered up to be
taken away for burial.</p>

<p>There was no sense of exultation in their
hearts, only a feeling that in a singular way justice
had been done to a man who had committed
the unpardonable crime of betraying his country.</p>

<p>They had been to mess that evening, and were
talking over the events of the day, when an orderly
came to say that Frank was wanted at
headquarters.</p>

<p>Wondering somewhat what the summons
might mean, and pursued by the chaff of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
friends, who predicted all sorts of dire things in
store for him, Frank obeyed the summons, and
was surprised and pleased to find Colonel Pavet
waiting to see him. The pleasure was felt also
by the colonel, as was shown by the warmth of
his greeting.</p>

<p>Each owed a great deal to the other. Frank,
as my old readers will remember, had saved the
colonel’s life when the latter was lying wounded
on the battlefield and had carried him off to
safety amid a storm of bullets. The colonel, on
the other hand, had been kindness itself in looking
after the interest of Frank’s mother in property
that had been left to her in France.</p>

<p>“Ah, Monsieur Sheldon, how glad I am to see
you again,” said Colonel Pavet.</p>

<p>“No more than I am to see you, sir,” returned
Frank, shaking the hand which the colonel in
sheer disregard of the difference in rank had extended
to him. “I hope that you are well.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly well, I thank you,” replied the
colonel, “and happy beyond expression at the
way things are going. It will not be long now
before the arrogant Huns will be driven from
France. Oh, what we Frenchmen owe to you
brave Americans! You are like the Crusaders
of old. You came to our aid when our backs
were against the wall and you gave us fresh courage,
new life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Just as your people did for America more
than a hundred years ago,” replied Frank. “You
don’t owe us anything, Colonel. We’ve simply
been paying a debt.”</p>

<p>“But paying it with interest a hundred fold,”
protested the colonel warmly. “But tell me how
things are going with you, <i>mon cher ami</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the same as usual,” returned Frank.
“The Hun bullets haven’t got me yet.”</p>

<p>“But that isn’t because you haven’t been where
the Hun bullets were,” smiled the colonel. “I’ve
been hearing of what you did on that scouting
expedition last night. It’s a marvel that you
came through it alive. But fortune favors the
brave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was nothing,” said Frank, who always
felt uncomfortable when anyone referred
to his exploits.</p>

<p>“Your officers think differently,” laughed the
colonel. “But now to other matters. In the
first place, I want to tell you how sorry I was
that I was away when that unfortunate accusation
was laid against you. A word from me
would have shown its falsity at once.”</p>

<p>“I know it would,” answered Frank, “but
luckily things took such a turn that I was soon
cleared of that charge.”</p>

<p>“The next thing is,” went on the colonel in a
tone of regret, “that some complications have developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
in the matter of your mother’s property.”</p>

<p>Frank felt his heart sink. It was only a little
while since he had written her, telling her that
everything was practically settled in her favor,
and that all she would have to do after the war
ended would be to take possession.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” he replied. “I thought
that the dying confession of that rascally butler
had established her claim beyond a doubt.”</p>

<p>“It did as far as the attempt to defraud her
was concerned,” answered the colonel. “This is
a technical matter bearing on the title to a part
of the estate. It seems that some legal formalities
were overlooked at the time of its acquisition.
My brother Andre explained it to me in his
last letter. But I am only a plain soldier and I
could not quite grasp the details. Now, don’t let it
worry you, for Andre thinks that the matter can
be attended to and the title made perfect. Only
it will take some time and I thought I ought to
notify you just how matters stood.”</p>

<p>“It’s very good of you,” replied Frank, relieved
to learn that the fears he had formed when
the colonel first began to speak of the matter
might be groundless. “Of course I’m sorry that
there’s any hitch at all, but if it can be remedied
it doesn’t matter so much.”</p>

<p>“Right,” agreed Colonel Pavet, “and if I
might be permitted to suggest, I would say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
nothing to your mother about it at present. If
it were anything really serious, of course she
ought to know. But under the circumstances it
would only cost her needless worry. Now I
must be going. Of course you know or have
guessed that there will be a great battle tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that we attack at dawn,” replied
Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes,” confirmed the colonel. “To you Americans
has been assigned the task of clearing out
the Argonne Forest. It is one of the most tremendous
tasks of the war but I know you will
be equal to it. My own regiment is with Gouraud’s
forces on your left. We will probably
effect a juncture with your forces after you have
taken the forest, and the two armies will have a
friendly race to see which gets to Sedan first.
The luck of battle may bring us together again
before long.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” smiled Frank, “and when we do
meet I hope that we can congratulate each other
on the complete defeat of the Huns.”</p>

<p>“We will,” replied the colonel with conviction.
“Their lines are bending now and are ready to
break. One more great effort and the work is
done. The Allied armies will spend Christmas
on the Rhine.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are as good a prophet as you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
a fighter,” laughed Frank. “But I believe in my
soul you’re right.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” replied the colonel. “And
now I must go. Remember me to your mother
when you write.”</p>

<p>They shook hands and separated, the colonel
mounting his horse which stood at the door, and
Frank with a final wave of the hand returning to
his comrades.</p>

<p>His sleep that night was as sound as though
the next day were to be a holiday, instead of
marking the beginning of one of the most desperate
battles of the war.</p>

<p>The reveille sounded while it was yet dark on
the following morning, and before the first faint
streak of dawn appeared in the eastern sky the
old Thirty-seventh was in line waiting for the
word to advance.</p>

<p>Before them in the semi-darkness loomed up
the gigantic shapes of the tanks that were to lead
the way and smash the barriers that the foe had
erected during the four years that they had held
the forest.</p>

<p>Thousands of men who were too old for military
service had been employed there in building
concrete fortifications, bombproof shelters and
underground passages leading from one trench
to another until the whole forest was a perfect
labyrinth from which the Germans would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to be driven foot by foot and trench by trench.
There were “pill boxes” by the hundred set up
in concealed locations that commanded the entire
territory. Snipers were in the lofty trees and
machine gun nests existed by thousands. There
were deep pits into which the unwary might fall.
Barbed wire entanglements added to the natural
difficulties of the position. Deep gulches and ravines
made it impossible for the troops to advance
in any kind of regular formations, and in
places there was only room for them to go in
single file over ground swept by enemy bullets.
Their heaviest batteries had been brought from
other portions of the line and concentrated there.</p>

<p>It was the Germans’ last stand. If they failed
to hold the Americans, their cause was lost. Back
of the forest was the railway line that ran from
Longuyon to Mezieres and Sedan. It was their
chief artery of supplies for all their armies in
France and Belgium. If the Americans once got
astride of that railway, the Germans would be
bottled up with no way of escape except through
the gateway of Liege.</p>

<p>Orders had gone out from the German High
Command that the forest must be held at any
cost, and their crack divisions of the Jagers and
the Prussian Guards had been brought up with
orders to die at their posts rather than retreat or
surrender. They had all the advantage of position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
They boasted that the forest could never
be taken. Even the Americans whom the Huns
had first learned to respect and afterward to fear,
could not, it was said, do what was beyond the
power of mortal men. It was simply impossible.
Had not the great Napoleon himself declined to
attack the enemy who held the forest in his day,
saying that it was impregnable?</p>

<p>But the American troops had learned to laugh
at the word “impossible.” They wouldn’t admit
that it was in their dictionary. They had been
told that their green troops could not hold the
Germans at the Marne, but they had held them.
They had been told that it was impossible to
break the Hindenburg line, but they had smashed
it to bits. They had been told that the St. Mihiel
salient could not be pinched out, but they did in
two days what others had failed to do in four
years. Now, when they heard that it was impossible
to clear the Argonne Forest, they simply
grinned. It was only a German joke.</p>

<p>“Wonder when the music will begin,” said
Frank, as he crouched beside Tom and Billy,
waiting for the thunder of the great guns to signal
the beginning of the attack.</p>

<p>“It won’t be long now,” replied Tom, as he
cast his eyes up to the sky where a faint light was
beginning to diffuse itself.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Stone is with this bunch of tanks
in front of us,” remarked Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I’d know his tank if I saw it, but it’s a little
too dark yet to make it out,” said Frank, as his
eye ran along the silent row of monsters that
stretched up and down the line. “But one thing’s
certain, if he isn’t in the front row at the start,
it won’t be long before he gets there.”</p>

<p>Men passed along the line with steaming buckets
of coffee, for the morning was chilly, and the
boys swallowed their portions with gusto and
passed the tins back for more.</p>

<p>“Gee, but that tastes good,” said Tom, smacking
his lips. “It warms me to the toes.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get exercise enough to keep you warm
before many minutes are past,” prophesied Billy.</p>

<p>“It can’t come too soon,” put in Frank, as his
fingers tightened over the stock of his rifle.</p>

<p>Just then the word came down the line:</p>

<p>“Fix bayonets!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>AT GRIPS WITH DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a series of clicks as the bayonets
slipped in their sockets.</p>

<p>“In less than five minutes now!” muttered
Tom.</p>

<p>Suddenly the great American guns opened up
with a roar that sounded as though the earth had
split asunder. There was a deeper bass note than
usual that the Army Boys’ trained ears detected
in an instant.</p>

<p>“Those must be the naval guns we’ve been
hearing so much about,” said Frank to Billy.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” replied Billy, “and they’re
some guns, too. I hear that they throw nearly a
ton of metal a distance of sixteen miles. They’re
the biggest guns that have ever been used in battle,
and they spell hard luck for the Heinies.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how we’re going to get across this
canal,” pondered Tom, as they waited for the
word to charge.</p>

<p>“Our engineers will have seen to that,” said
Frank confidently. “Trust those boys to be on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the job. Maybe it will be rafts, maybe pontoons.
You remember how we got across the Meuse the
other time. At the worst we can swim it.”</p>

<p>But as it grew lighter with each succeeding
minute, they saw that they would not have to
swim. During the night, the engineers had assembled
a string of barges which they had laid
beside each other and covered with planking.
The work had been done under fire and the losses
had been heavy, but the engineers were of the
same plucky type as those who had dropped their
picks and shovels and gone into the fight at Cambrai,
and those others who had helped Carey to
stop the gap on the road to Amiens. They had
stuck to their job until their work was done, and
several such bridges were now ready for use at
different points along the American line.</p>

<p>“Stand ready,” came the command that
thrilled the Army Boys from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Charge!”</p>

<p>With a rousing cheer the line swept forward,
and the greatest battle of the war was on.</p>

<p>The American guns laid down a barrage, a
veritable curtain of fire that went before their
men and kept lifting as the line advanced so as
not to kill their own men. The Americans were
so eager to get forward that this was an ever
present danger, and many lives had been lost in
the earlier battles of the war from this cause.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
But now the men were veterans, and while they
were just as full of ardor and eagerness as ever,
they had learned not to throw their lives away
by being over rash.</p>

<p>A hail of fire came from the German guns as
the first detachments reached the bridges and began
to cross. Great lanes were torn in the American
ranks, but they closed up at once like the
water in the wake of a ship.</p>

<p>The tanks went first, and though the floating
bridges swayed beneath their weight they were
soon safely on the other side of the canal. After
they had reached the bank, they halted for the
infantry to come up and form rank in the shelter
of their armored sides. The bullets rattled
against them until the din was like that of a
boiler factory. Two of them were struck by
monster shells that put them out of action, but
the majority of them came through the storm of
fire without material damage.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the first detachments of infantry
had crossed the bridges, although their
losses were heavy and the planks of the bridge
were red. Some had been swept into the canal
and the water was dotted with bodies, some motionless,
while others, who were only wounded,
sought to swim to the nearer shore or were rescued
by American boats that put out into the
stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The old Thirty-seventh had been given the
post of honor in their section of the line and the
Army Boys were in the first rank. A bullet
clipped off a lock of Billy’s hair just above the
ear, and one had pierced the sleeve of Frank’s
arm, blistering the skin as it went along as
though it had been seared by a hot iron. But the
lads were so full of the spirit of the fight that
they scarcely noticed these trifles when they
brought up breathless on the further side.</p>

<p>“So far so good,” gasped Frank, as he and his
comrades halted to draw breath in the shelter of
a great tank.</p>

<p>“Talk about hundred yard dashes!” exclaimed
Billy. “I’ll bet we came near beating the record
for crossing bridges.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” grinned Tom, as he took off
his helmet to wipe his forehead. “I think we beat
it that time when we scurried over the broken
bridge like jack rabbits with the Uhlan cavalry
only a dozen jumps in the rear. But we’re lucky
this time as we were then, and we’ve come
through with scarcely a scratch.”</p>

<p>“Knock wood,” warned Billy. “This is only
the curtain raiser. The real play is yet to come.”</p>

<p>In less than an hour, sufficient forces had
crossed the bridges to justify the officers in ordering
an advance against the first line of the
enemy trenches that had been established just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
within the edge of the forest. The trenches were
heavily manned and bristled with field and machine
guns, while back of them in the grim and
forbidding forest stretched other lines of defense
that the boys knew would cost thousands of
American lives to take. But the job was there
and had to be done. And they vowed in their
hearts that it should be done.</p>

<p>The huge tanks lined up for the attack and
got once more in action. Into the woods they
went, crushing down trees as though they were
pipe stems, lurching into and out of shell craters,
tearing into the barbed wire entanglements,
plucking up the posts to which they were fastened
and opening huge gaps into which came
pouring the long lines of shouting, cheering men.
Like an avalanche they struck the trenches, and
the Germans poured out to meet them.</p>

<p>The opposing lines swayed back and forth like
gladiators in a death grip. Then they broke up
into hundreds of battling groups, a dozen men
here, twenty there, struggling with bayonets and
rifle butts, hacking, stabbing and at times throwing
their empty guns aside and fighting with
knives and even with fists. It was the kind of
close-in fighting in which the Americans excelled
and which they always sought when the plan of
battle made it possible.</p>

<p>Frank, Tom and Billy fought as closely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
company as they could, and many a blow had
been warded off by one of the three from the
others that would otherwise have found its mark.</p>

<p>For a long time the battle seemed to be fairly
even, for the Germans fought with the fury of
desperation and were constantly reinforced from
heavy divisions kept in reserve. Each side attached
especial importance to this first stage of
the fight, because of the influence it might have
on the morale of their men. The side that lost
in the first phase of the battle would be depressed,
while the side that won would be correspondingly
elated and strengthened in spirit for the struggles
that were yet to come.</p>

<p>But American blood and American fighting
qualities were not to be denied. Gradually the
Germans were pressed back, but as they retreated
they kept up a stubborn resistance by
means of machine gun nests posted in every conceivable
place, at every turn in the forest paths,
in clumps of bushes, in forks of trees. They
made the Americans pay dearly for every foot
of ground that they gained.</p>

<p>But the Americans had learned by long experience
not to advance in mass formation against
these messengers of death. They spread out in
units and in groups, worming their way through
the bushes, seeking the shelter of every rock and
tree and shell hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>In following up this method of fighting, the
three Army Boys were separated. Frank found
himself in a shell hole alone. He peered over
the edge and could see nothing of Tom and Billy.
He crouched low in the hole, reloading his rifle.
Then he took stock of his position.</p>

<p>About three hundred feet ahead of him was a
machine gun nest that was spitting bullets in a
steady stream. It was sheltered by a barricade
of logs about four feet high. Behind this the
German machine gunners were snugly ensconced
and seemed to defy capture. They kept slewing
their gun from side to side of the barricade so
that it commanded the whole front of the position,
and their bullets went hissing over the open
space like so many snakes and quite as deadly.</p>

<p>Frank pondered as to what he should do and
a wild thought came into his mind. At least it
would have seemed wild at the beginning of his
experience in the war. But he had taken so many
risks and gotten away with them that he had
grown inclined to trust his luck.</p>

<p>He was going to put that particular machine
gun out of business. But how could he do it
single-handed?</p>

<p>They could fire a hundred bullets to his one.</p>

<p>His keen eye studied the ground in front of
him.</p>

<p>There were perhaps half a dozen shell holes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
between him and the barricade. But they were
too far apart for him to slip from one to another
without being seen. And to be seen in that bullet
swept place meant certain death.</p>

<p>But he also noted another thing. A heavy
German field gun from a distance of miles behind
the lines was sending huge shells that were
falling with tolerable regularity in the space between
him and the barricade. Every minute or
two, a shell would explode with a tremendous
roar, sending a volume of black smoke and tons
of dirt into the air.</p>

<p>Here was the solution of Frank’s problem.</p>

<p>He measured the distance between him and the
next shell hole, and poised himself for a spring
when the next shell should fall.</p>

<p>It came, and on the instant Frank was out of
his hole and rushing toward the next behind the
screen of smoke and dirt. He dropped into it
and waited for the next shell. Several times this
was repeated, until at last Frank found himself
in the last shell hole less than fifty feet away
from the barricade. This was his limit of possible
shelter. The rest of the way he must be in
the open.</p>

<p>He crouched low in the hole, waiting for a
favorable moment. Just at that time bullets were
whistling directly above his head. But he had
noted that the gunners were sweeping their gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
about in a semicircle, so as to command all portions
of the open space, and he knew that in a
moment or two the line of fire would be on one
side or the other of the direct line that lay between
him and the barricade.</p>

<p>How many men there might be in the machine
gun crew he did not know. There would surely
be two, perhaps half a dozen. He did not greatly
care. In that moment of intense exaltation he
would have fought a regiment.</p>

<p>The bullets ceased to sing above his head. He
peered cautiously above the edge of the hole.
The wicked looking muzzle of the machine gun
was pointing considerably to his left.</p>

<p>He leaped from the hole and raced for the
barricade.</p>

<p>There was a startled shout and a frantic effort
to slew the gun around. The next instant Frank
sprang high in the air, struck the topmost log
of the barricade with both feet and sent it tumbling
down upon the machine gun crew while he
went down with it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>PUTTING IT OVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a wild scrambling and confusion
in the machine gun nest, as the log came down,
followed by Frank.</p>

<p>The latter lost his balance and went down on
all fours, but was on his feet again in a second.</p>

<p>The log had struck one of the crew in falling
and knocked him unconscious. But his companion
in serving the gun had risen to his feet
at the same moment with Frank and had drawn
his revolver to fire. Frank had no time to raise
his rifle, but quick as lightning he swung it from
the level of his waist against the upraised arm
of his opponent. There was a sharp crack that
told that the bone was broken, and the man sank
to the ground with a groan.</p>

<p>Frank heard a shout just behind him and
wheeled about. A helmeted head was emerging
from a trench that had been dug in the rear of
the machine gun, and in this a squad of Germans
had been stationed to support the crew.</p>

<p>Frank’s rifle spoke, and the German sank back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
with a bullet through his shoulder. Two jumps
carried Frank to the head of the trench, where
he saw seven Huns, who had evidently been rattled
by the fall of their leader and were hesitating,
not knowing how many enemies might be
waiting for them on the ground above.</p>

<p>Frank covered them with his rifle, whose muzzle
darted from one to the other in the line.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The words were American, but the Germans
understood what it meant. If they had any
doubt, the rifle would have enlightened them.</p>

<p>Their guns dropped from their hands and they
raised the latter above their heads.</p>

<p>“<i>Kamerad!</i>” they shouted in chorus.</p>

<p>Still keeping them covered, Frank motioned
them to come out one at a time. They did so
and formed in line, their hands still upraised.
The look of amazement on their faces, when they
looked around for Frank’s comrades and failed
to see them, was comical beyond expression. But
Frank was too keyed up at that moment to pay
any attention to the humorous side of it.</p>

<p>He shot a glance at the machine gun. It had
been knocked down by the falling log and the
machinery by which it was fed with cartridges
was unusable.</p>

<p>“March!” Frank commanded, taking his station
in the rear of the line of prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>They obeyed sheepishly enough, and one or
two of them in the rear of the line were inclined
to be sullen, but a sharp jab of Frank’s bayonet
decided them, and they went off at a jog trot toward
the American lines.</p>

<p>They had covered perhaps two-thirds of the
way, when Frank met a squad of his own regiment
who were advancing after clearing out a
ravine. They raised a shout as they saw Frank
coming along herding his flock, and in a moment
he was surrounded and overwhelmed with eager
questions.</p>

<p>“Where are the rest of the fellows that helped
you take this bunch?” asked Corporal Wilson,
who was in command of the squad.</p>

<p>“There weren’t any others,” answered Frank.
“I just happened to get the draw on this crowd
and gathered them in.”</p>

<p>“‘Happened’ is good,” said Wilson dryly.
“There’s more to it than that. You’ll have to
tell us about it later. In the meantime, I’ll have
these fellows sent to the rear.”</p>

<p>The prisoners were sent back, and Frank went
forward with his comrades for further fighting.
Under other circumstances, he would have liked
to rest for a while, for he had been under a terrific
strain and now he was feeling the reaction.
But there was stern work yet to be done, and
the resting time could come later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Tom and Billy had worked their way in his
direction and now rejoined him. They moved
forward and soon reached the scene of Frank’s
exploit. The German who had been knocked
unconscious had evidently come to his senses and
had disappeared, but the two men whom Frank
had wounded were still there. A stretcher party
working in that part of the field was signaled,
and the men were taken away to the hospital.</p>

<p>“Some classy work!” exclaimed Billy, when at
his eager urging Frank had told to him and Tom
the incidents of the fight. “If you don’t get the
Distinguished Service Cross for this, there’s no
gratitude in the United States army.”</p>

<p>“Billy’s right,” declared Tom, as he clapped
Frank on the shoulder. “There isn’t one man in
a thousand who would have thought of it or
done it if he had thought of it. Frank, old man,
you’re a wonder.”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it,” said Frank. “I had a chance
and took it. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” mimicked Tom. “You had a
chance and took it. We’ll let it go at that.”</p>

<p>All that morning the fighting continued, and
the Germans were steadily driven back. By noon
the edge of the forest had been cleared, and the
Americans began to consolidate their lines in
preparation for the next advance.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve won the first round anyway,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
remarked Billy jubilantly, as the Army Boys
gathered in a trench that had been hastily constructed
and sat down to eat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Tom, “but there may be a
good many rounds to this fight. Heinie’s got
lots of fight in him yet and don’t you forget it.
He knows he’s in the last ditch and that if he
doesn’t stand here, it’s all up with him.”</p>

<p>“Quit your croaking,” admonished Billy.
“We’ve got the Indian sign on him and he knows
it. This last ditch business doesn’t go with the
Huns. They’re all right when they’re winning,
but they can’t stand losing. They don’t want
their cities devastated in the same way that
they’ve ruined the cities of France and Belgium.
When the time comes they’ll cave in. You just
wait and see what kind of a prophet little Billy
is.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re both right,” said Frank. “I
agree with Tom that we’re due for one big fight
before Heinie will admit defeat. But I also
think with Billy that when that defeat comes
they’ll curl up and quit so quickly it will make
your head swim. But what’s the use of our chinning
about it and letting our chow get cold? All
we’ve got to do is to fight. We’ll leave it to
Pershing and Foch and the other men at the
head of things to settle things with the Germans
after we’ve licked them to a frazzle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>They attacked their meal with an appetite
sharpened by the strenuous work of the morning,
and then at the call of the bugle they again took
their place in the line to finish the work they
had so well begun.</p>

<p>From that time on, the work was more like
guerrilla fighting than any battle in which they
had engaged so far. The woods were so thick
and the obstructions so many that it was impossible
to advance in anything like regular formation.
Instead of tens of thousands of men being
hurled against other ten thousands in a mass attack,
both armies were broken up into countless
groups of ten, twenty and a hundred men, each
following a general plan of advance but depending
upon circumstances and natural conditions as
to the way they carried out that plan.</p>

<p>The Germans had the advantage of a greater
familiarity with the ground, which they had held
for years, and also in their tremendously strong
system of defenses. But the Americans had
against these the consciousness that they had
beaten this enemy in every fight where they had
met them, and the feeling that they could always
beat them. Then, too, the Americans were more
accustomed to act on their own responsibility.
If their officers were killed or wounded, they figured
out for themselves what was the best thing
to do and went ahead and did it. In a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
sense, every private was a general when he had to
be. The Germans, on the other hand, were excellent
fighters in the mass. But they needed to
have their shoulders touching those of their comrades,
and they had been taught to rely so utterly
upon the directions of their officers that they felt
lost and bewildered when they had to make decisions
for themselves. Of course there were
exceptions, but this fairly expressed the difference
between the two armies.</p>

<p>Not only that day but for many days thereafter
the fighting kept on. The Americans had
given themselves two weeks to clear the forest.
Day by day the lines advanced, sometimes slowly,
again more quickly, but they always advanced,
and every nightfall found them nearer their goal
than they had been the day before.</p>

<p>The Army Boys were in their element. Here
at last was enough fighting to suit even their hot
blood. The only thing lacking to their satisfaction
was the absence of Bart.</p>

<p>They had not yet even been able to hear from
him, as they were kept so busy and the lines
shifted so constantly that all communication between
them and the hospital was cut off.</p>

<p>“It’s hard luck for the old scout,” remarked
Tom one night after the regiment had cleared out
an intricate system of dugouts and was resting
after the day’s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“He’ll be sore as the mischief if this war ends
without his getting another crack at the Huns,”
said Billy.</p>

<p>“He needn’t worry,” put in Frank, “he’s done
his full share if he never fires another shot. All
I want is to see him on his feet again, sound and
well, whether the war ends before that time or
not. In the meantime we three must try to do
the work of four.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Tom, “every fourth shot we
fire, we’ll say to ourselves: ‘There goes one for
Bart!’”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE SHINING PLANE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> one day of particularly grim and stubborn
fighting, the Army Boys found themselves
quartered in an unusually large clearing in the
dense woods and underbrush that went to compose
the Argonne Forest. Since early morning
they had been engaged in clearing out trench
after trench of Boches, menaced on every side by
skillfully concealed machine gun nests, but making
steady progress, in the face of almost insuperable
obstacles. A number of their comrades
had fallen, but not one of our heroes had
suffered anything worse than the deep scratches
resulting from forcing their way through innumerable
barbed wire entanglements. They
seemed to bear charmed lives, for always there
had been the whine of machine gun bullets, and
the scream of shrapnel thrown from the heavier
guns situated in the rear of the German lines.</p>

<p>Now, thoroughly exhausted, they had willingly
obeyed the order that meant the end of that day’s
fighting, and had cast, first their packs, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
themselves, down upon the camping ground that
had been designated as theirs for the night.</p>

<p>By the time “chow” had been eaten, they began
to feel a little better, but had nothing in mind except
to turn in, when suddenly their attention
was arrested by the whirring hum of an aeroplane
engine coming rapidly to a position directly
over them. The first thought of every soldier is,
“Is it an enemy machine?” but one glance served
to assure them that it was an American plane.</p>

<p>They naturally expected that the machine
would continue on its course, but suddenly Frank
exclaimed, “Look at that, fellows! It’s circling
around as though the pilot intended to land.
What in the world would he want to come down
here for?”</p>

<p>“Possibly he’s been having engine trouble,”
speculated Tom. And he was not far wrong, for
this was indeed the reason for the aviator’s sudden
descent. Spying the opening in the trees, he
had decided to make a landing there, rather than
proceed further and take the chance of being
forced to descend in even a more unfavorable
location.</p>

<p>The boys watched with interest as the machine
descended lower and lower in graceful spirals,
and finally took the ground as the aviator landed
skillfully on a smooth patch of turf.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Frank, as the friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
started to run toward it, “there’s something about
that aviator that looks mighty familiar to me. I
knew it!” a moment later, “it’s good old Dick
Lever, and he’s sure a sight for sore eyes. How
in the name of all that’s good did he ever happen
to get in this part of the world, I wonder.”</p>

<p>This question was soon answered, for by now
the boys had reached the machine, and amid joyful
shouts Dick Lever was dragged from the
pilot’s seat and laughingly told to “give an account
of himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not very hard to do,” he said,
“provided, of course, that you Indians don’t pull
me limb from limb before I get the chance to.
It’s fine to be so welcome, but I’m beginning to be
afraid I’ll never be able to live through it. Have
a heart, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“All right, then, come across with the information,”
laughed Frank. “We’re so used to questioning
Hun prisoners, that we’ve got the habit,
and find it hard to be easy with you, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s not much to tell,” said the aviator.
“I was just recently detailed to this sector,
and since arriving here I have been having
a busy time of it, I can tell you. The Boches on
this sector are right on the job, and don’t seem to
scare nearly so easily as they generally do. I
had a brush with one several hours ago, and
chased him well back of the German lines. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
landed safely, though, so I turned around to get
back, when my engine started missing. It wasn’t
so very bad, but I thought it would be better to
land and tinker it up before it got worse, so when
I saw this opening through the tops of the trees,
I decided to come down and see if I couldn’t
make temporary repairs. But if I had known
you fellows were down here waiting for me, I
think I’d have come down even faster than I did.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, “let’s take a look at your
engine, and see if we can’t locate the trouble.
But I won’t really be sorry if we don’t, because
then you’ll have to stay here all night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true enough,” replied Dick. “But
just at present I don’t want to be put out of business
over night if I can help it. Every aviator on
this sector is on the lookout for a certain Boche
plane that has been making a pest of itself around
here, and the one that succeeds in bringing him
down is going to be considered a real ace.”</p>

<p>“Why, has he been doing such a lot of damage?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Damage!” exclaimed Dick, “I should say he
has been doing damage. And not only that, but
he does it in such a way that none of us so far
has had any chance for a comeback.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p>“His favorite stunt is to come over our lines
along about dusk, and drop his load of bombs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
where he thinks they will do the most good. Then
he makes a quick turn about and escapes, either
going directly back to his lines, or, more often,
rising high enough to reach a cloud stratum, and
hiding in that. And by the time our fellows get
out after him, it’s so dark that there’s no chance
of seeing him. He’s responsible for the death of
any number of our fellows, and nobody knows
how much damage to roads and ammunition
trains.”</p>

<p>“That’s the Boche’s regular game,” commented
Frank, bitterly, “their ’planes always run
the minute they think a superior force is coming
out against them. It would be wonderful if you
could be the one to capture him, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful! I should say it would,” exclaimed
the young aviator. “But that tricky
way he has of cloud hiding, together with his
habit of only attacking right on the edge of darkness,
makes it a mighty hard proposition to come
up with him. But I or one of the other fellows
will get him eventually, never fear.”</p>

<p>“If only there were some way to tag him so
that he could be followed easier,” said Frank,
slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s a pretty big if,” said Billy,
“supposing you come down to earth and give us
some practical suggestion about how it’s going
to be done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Well, maybe I will,” replied Frank, to whom
had come the glimmering of an idea, “you fellows
know that illuminating paint they use for signs,
and so forth, so that they can be read in the dark,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” exclaimed Dick, who grasped
the other’s thought in the twinkling of an eye,
“if we could douse this Boche’s plane with some
of that mixture, a blind man could follow his
progress after dark. But then,” he concluded,
less enthusiastically, “the problem arises as to
how we are going to get the paint on his machine.
It reminds me of trying to catch a bird by putting
salt on his tail.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might be worth trying, anyway,” said
Frank, defending his project. “Why couldn’t
you take a pail of this with you, and then there’s
a bare possibility that you might be able to drop
some of it on him. One splash of that stuff on
his machine, and you’d have the easiest job in the
world following him. The darker the night, the
better.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, it’s worth trying, anyway,” said
Dick, caught up on a wave of enthusiasm. “I’ll try
anything once, anyway. But now the question
is, where are we going to get the paint?”</p>

<p>“There’s a supply wagon not over a mile from
here,” replied Frank, “if you’re game for the
hike, I’ll go with you, and we’ll see if we can’t get
some.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“You’re on!” exclaimed the aviator. “You
two fellows stay here to see that no one monkeys
with my machine,” addressing Billy Waldon and
Tom Bradford.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tom. “But you’d better
shake a foot or some of this bunch will be taking
your machine apart for souvenirs,” and he laughingly
indicated the interested group of doughboys
who had by this time sauntered up.</p>

<p>Frank and Dick set off at a smart pace, as they
were all eagerness to try the novel experiment,
and there was no time to lose, if it were to be done
that night, as it was then after five o’clock, and
nearing the time at which the German aviator
usually made his raids. They maintained a brisk
pace, and it was not long before they reached a
group of supply wagons, carrying all sorts of
supplies and equipment. They had some difficulty
in explaining matters to the officer in
charge, but at last he was moved by their enthusiasm,
and gave them permission to draw a small
pail full of the illuminating paint. This was a
special mixture of chemicals, and was extensively
used by our army for signs, indicating arrows,
etc., where it was impossible or inconvenient to
have a special light to show up the object at night.</p>

<p>The two friends made short work of the return
trip, and surprised those waiting for them by the
promptitude of their return.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Billy, “I can see the finish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
of that Boche already, when two speed merchants
like you go romping on his trail. He’s got about
as much chance as a cootie in a disinfecting
tank.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got much time to spare,” said
Dick; “it’s getting dark already, and I’ve still
got to clean the spark plugs in my machine.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all help you do that,” volunteered Tom,
and with wrenches that Dick gave them, they
soon had the offending spark plugs apart, thoroughly
cleaned, and restored to their proper
sphere of usefulness. Then, while some of the
onlooking soldiers held the plane, Dick gave the
propeller a whirl, and the motor started with a
reassuring roar.</p>

<p>“That sounds good,” said Dick, as he climbed
into the pilot’s seat. “Now, hand me up that
paint, and I’m off on the trail of the Hun.”</p>

<p>Billy handed him the pail, and Dick, after carefully
depositing it at his feet, waved his hand in
farewell. The boys had just started a cheer for
him, when they were interrupted by the sound of
a heavy detonation. For a brief space the artillery
of both sides had been silent, and they
could tell from the sound of the explosion that it
was not caused by a gun. Even as they all listened,
it came again,—a dull, heavy shock that
caused the very earth to shake, and this time it
seemed nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“That’s our Boche friend!” exclaimed Dick
Lever. “Let her go, boys! Maybe this time I’ll
have the luck to get the brute!” and as the
soldiers loosed their holds, the aeroplane swept
forward, and then, at a quick motion on Dick’s
part, soared gracefully into the air. Dick
slanted swiftly upward into the gathering twilight,
and soon became indistinguishable to the
straining eyes of those on the ground. Only the
sound of his whirring motor remained to tell
them of the gallant man willingly risking his life
for his country.</p>

<p>As the sound of his motor grew fainter, the
throb of another engine insensibly mingled with
it, but the later comer had the irregular pulsations
that all the Americans recognized as coming from
a German machine.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager anything that’s the Boche!” exclaimed
Tom, and everybody there agreed with
him. It was now almost fully dark, and although
the boys strained their eyes they could
make out nothing of the duel that was going on a
mile or two above the earth.</p>

<p>But suddenly a weird and fascinating thing
happened. From out the black vault of the night
sky a rippling, streaming cascade of fire leaped
downward for a space, and then suddenly mushroomed
out in a sparkling splash of phosphorescent
light. Smaller stars and streamers spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
out in all directions and gradually melted out as
they fell earthward. But there remained a faint,
ghostlike, unreal patch of swiftly moving light,
that the breathless watchers knew must be the
Boche aeroplane.</p>

<p>“It worked!” exclaimed Frank. “That Hun
aviator is done for now, because Dick can see
him, and he can’t see Dick.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, a stream of red fire spit
viciously out from a point slightly above the German,
who had now turned and was flying for dear
life back to his own lines. For a space the weird
attack continued, and the German, apparently
giving up hope of safety in flight, turned and
fired desperately toward the stream of deadly fire
that marked the position of Dick’s machine gun.</p>

<p>But suddenly, one of the deadly bullets from
the machine gun got home, for the patch of light
marking the Hun machine, wavered, swerved,
and then dived swiftly earthward.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>TANK AGAINST TANK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> sigh arose from the group of soldiers
gazing spellbound on this drama of war. The
German aeroplane fell swiftly until it was perhaps
halfway to the earth, and then straightened
out for a second, hesitated, and started turning
over and over as it neared the uprushing earth.
The top of its wings seemed fairly covered with
the greenish luminous paint, that smoked and
glowed and gave the ill-fated aeroplane the appearance
of a gigantic pinwheel as it came hurtling
earthward.</p>

<p>For what seemed a long time to the fascinated
watchers, but was in reality only a brief space of
time, the machine continued its downward course,
and then disappeared as it fell below the fringe of
treetops marking the edge of the clearing. It
seemed to have landed quite near, but the Americans,
experienced in these matters, knew that it
was probably a matter of two or three miles from
where they stood.</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Frank at last, drawing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
long breath, “there’s one less murdering Boche
for Uncle Sam to deal with. May their tribe decrease!”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Tom. “I wonder if Dick has
come off safely?”</p>

<p>The others also felt anxiety on this point, but
it was soon dispelled, for they heard the sound of
his motor as he descended rapidly. Of course, it
was impossible for him to land now, on account
of the darkness, but as he swooped low over the
treetops he fired a few rounds of ammunition
from his machine gun, by way of greeting, and
the boys raised a lusty cheer, which, however, it
is very doubtful if he heard, owing to the noise
of his motor. Then he straightened out in a
line for the aeroplane base in back of the American
lines, and gradually the hum of his motor
faded out in the distance.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll come across the remains of that
German machine when we advance tomorrow,”
speculated Billy. “But whether we do or not,
that ought to be a tip for our airmen. That was
one idea of yours, Frank, that wasn’t quite as bad
as the majority of your ideas.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I can have an idea that works out like
that one once in a while, I’m entitled to have a
few poor ones,” retorted Frank, and retired with
the honors of war.</p>

<p>By this time “taps” was almost due, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
boys set about rigging up their “pup” tents, and
getting ready for the night. In spite of the weariness
caused by the strenuous and exciting day,
they managed to stay awake long enough to discuss
the thrilling air battle they had witnessed,
but then fell asleep until the notes of “reveille”
recalled them to another day of this stern game
called war.</p>

<p>The next morning they were up with the first
notes of the bugle, and by the time dawn had
fairly broken were through breakfast and ready
for what the day might bring forth. Then the
bugle blew the “assembly” and the soldiers fell
into orderly ranks, standing at attention while
muster was read.</p>

<p>Their commanding officer then gave them a
short talk in which he praised their progress on
the preceding day, and expressed his confidence
that they would do as well or better today. Then
the order was given to advance, and the formation
moved forward at a walk, keeping as good a
line as possible over the broken terrain, but inevitably
breaking up into small parties as the difficulties
of the advance became more and more
pronounced.</p>

<p>The Germans had apparently retreated to a
considerable distance, for at first the Americans
met with no opposition except that offered by the
tangles of barbed wire and abandoned trenches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
with which they were continually coming into
contact. Frank, Billy and Tom kept a lookout
in every direction for the destroyed German aeroplane,
but their vigilance was doomed to go unrewarded,
for they saw not a sign of it.</p>

<p>By noon time the Americans had begun to
come in contact with the enemy again, and were
again engaged in the grim business of clearing
out stubbornly held trenches and machine gun
nests. The Germans fought for every foot of
ground, but were slowly but surely forced backward,
ever giving way to men who were better
soldiers than they were. Always they had the
advantage of carefully planned and constructed
fortifications, and yet always they were beaten
out of them. By noon the Americans had registered
a satisfactory advance, and the order was
given to rest while the wearied soldiers were
given food and a chance to get a very much
needed rest.</p>

<p>Soon after our three friends had eased the
packs off their aching shoulders and thrown themselves
on the ground, they saw a small party of
five men, three of whom were officers, approach
their commanding officer, and after the usual salutes,
enter into conversation with him. Shortly
afterward, the two non-commissioned men were
dismissed, and strolled over toward the three
friends. Seeing them coming, these latter hospitably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
offered tobacco, matches, and chewing
gum, and shortly learned that the newcomers
were members of the Tank Corps. One of them
had seen a good deal of service in this comparatively
new branch of the Army, and with a little
skillful urging was led to talk of some of his
experiences.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, in answer to a question from
Tom, “some pretty queer things happen out there
in no man’s land, and the tanks get their share, I
can tell you. I’ve had experiences myself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” said Frank. “But these
tanks seem to have put a great fear into the
Boches, at that.”</p>

<p>“You bet they have!” exclaimed the other,
“and it’s too bad that we can’t use them very
much here. But of course, with all these trees
and the thick underbrush, they’re practically out
of the question. But that’s what we’re here for
now—looking over the ground, to see if in some
places they can’t be used to some extent.”</p>

<p>“I’ve often wondered,” said Billy, “why the
Huns haven’t used tanks more. They don’t seem
to have anything like the success with them that
our men have had.”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, they’re not as well made,
and when it comes to tank against tank, we almost
always out-manœuvre them,” said Arney, for
such was the tank man’s name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I’ve often wondered what would happen if
two tanks had a pitched battle,” said Frank, “I
suppose that happens sometimes, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Often enough,” said Arney. “I was in one
once that stacked up against a Boche tank, so I
am in a position to know, if anyone is.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” queried Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, the way it happened was this,” replied
the other, “our side had planned an attack one
morning at dawn, but as it happened, the German
had also planned one against us at the same time.
Of course, neither side knew what the other
was up to, so it came as a pretty big surprise when
the Boches opened their bombardment just a few
minutes before ours was due to commence.</p>

<p>“This didn’t stop us, though, and our batteries
opened up full split in reply. My tank was due
to start out at six o’clock, and promptly on schedule
we got away. It was still pitch dark, though,
and raining as usual, and as neither side was
sending up star shells for fear of exposing their
own operations, we had very little to guide us.
We lost our way a couple of times, at the same
time falling behind our schedule, and when we
finally did get on the right track, we trundled
along at top speed. Top speed doesn’t mean
very much to a tank, to look at it from the outside,
but when you’re on the inside, with the engine
going full split, and rocking along over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
ground that’s been ploughed up about a million
times by big shells, you certainly do know you’re
moving.</p>

<p>“Well, we had travelled maybe half a mile,
when suddenly we stopped dead, with a slam that
nearly took my teeth out. At first I thought we
must have hit a big tree, but then I remembered
that all the trees around that section had been
blasted into kindling wood a good many months
ago, and as about everything else had shared the
same fate, I didn’t know what had happened to
us. But in a few seconds we had our searchlight
going, and then I found out what was the matter
pretty quick. There in front of us, butted square
into us, was a big Boche tank.”</p>

<p>Here the narrator paused to roll a cigarette,
while the boys waited impatiently for him to go
on. After deliberately making and lighting his
cigarette, he took a few deep puffs, and resumed
his narrative.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, I figured we were up against it for
fair in more ways than one. The driver put her
into low gear, and threw in the clutch again and
again, but it was no use. I suppose the other
fellow was doing the same thing, and neither of
us could budge an inch. Then, first thing we
knew, a big explosive bullet came crashing
through our armor, and stretched the driver over
his seat, done for for good. I depressed my gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
as far as it would go, and tried to get back at the
Boche, but he could get his gun lower than I could
get mine, and my bullets just bounced off his
armor, because they hit it at such a big angle.</p>

<p>“I went down and told our lieutenant how
things stood, and he took the place of the dead
driver, and threw her into reverse, but the Boche
realized his advantage, and followed us up so
close that I never got a chance to get a direct hit
on him. It looked pretty bad for us, and I
thought it was about time to say ‘Good-bye, sweet
world, good-bye.’ But the Lieutenant kept his
wits about him, and suddenly had an idea.</p>

<p>“As we backed down into a big shell crater, he
waited until the nose of the Boche tank came rolling
over the edge, and then suddenly shot our machine
forward, so that it slid in under the German.
That gave me my chance, and maybe you
think I didn’t take advantage of it. I began
pumping steel jacketed bullets in through the floor
of that tank so fast they must have thought it
was a machine gun doing it. They saw what
they were up against, and tried to retire. But
we followed them close, and never gave them a
chance to get away.</p>

<p>“Seeing that they couldn’t escape that way,
they suddenly reversed and tried to climb over us,
but the Lieutenant was some driver, I can tell
you, and reversed about as quickly as they did, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
that was no go. Oh, we had them right that
time, and no doubt about it.”</p>

<p>Here Arney took a last lingering puff at the
remnants of his cigarette, and regretfully tossed
it away.</p>

<p>“Well, how did it end?” questioned Billy,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, we got their gasoline tank, and then it
was all over,” replied Arney, “of course, all the
time the Lieutenant was backing and filling, I was
pumping bullets into them for all I was worth.
Suddenly there came a terrific explosion, and the
whole inside of that tank was on fire with burning
gasoline. That finished those who were left
in it, and then we backed away from under, and
as our men had reached their objectives by that
time, we returned to our own lines. We were
pretty well torn up by the encounter, but still had
a little fight left in us.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Billy, when Arney had concluded
his narrative, “I think that’s the service I’d
like to get into. You get some excitement there.”</p>

<p>“You are certainly hard to please!” exclaimed
Tom. “Chances are you’ll get all the excitement
you want this afternoon, when we get in touch
with the Germans again. Making a frontal attach
on a machine gun emplacement is all the excitement
my young heart craves.”</p>

<p>“You’re probably easily satisfied,” grinned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Billy. “But if your young heart craves that
method of diversion, we’ll let you go after the
next one all by your lonesome.”</p>

<p>Arney grinned at this exchange of repartee,
and then, shaking hands all around, took his departure.
Shortly afterward the bugle sounded,
and once more the tedious and costly attack was
resumed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>LIQUID FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was soon apparent that contact with the
Germans had been made in earnest, for the resistance,
which had been comparatively light in the
morning, stiffened perceptibly. Machine gun
nests became more and more frequent, and in
every case the machine gunners stood by their
pieces until the last man was killed, or the gun put
out of action.</p>

<p>The Americans advanced as they could, some
parts of the line of course preceding others, according
to the resistance offered by the Germans.
The portion in which the three friends were
placed met with particularly stubborn resistance.
They had to advance into a crossfire from several
closely connected machine gun emplacements, but
that was what they were there for, and they advanced
to the task with a dogged persistence that
shook the nerves of the Germans.</p>

<p>“This is getting to be pretty hot work,” panted
Frank. “We’ve got to clean up some of those
fellows pretty quick, or they’re going to clean us
up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“All right, then, up and at ’em!” exclaimed
Tom, and with a shout the three friends dashed
forward, crouching low to avoid the storm of machine
gun bullets that whizzed by over their heads.
On they dashed, until they reached the parapet
surrounding one machine gun. Without a pause,
they leaped over this, and, using their revolvers
with deadly effect, quickly despatched the Germans
who formed its crew.</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” gritted Frank, the lust of
battle in his eyes. “There’s another parapet over
there, fellows, and it’s a cinch there’s one of
these hornets concealed behind it. Let’s get
after it before the crew discovers us. They’re
not firing now, but they’re apt to begin any minute.”</p>

<p>“We’re with you!” shouted Tom and Billy,
and the three fearless Americans raced for this
new obstacle. It seemed strange that the Germans
did not open fire on them, but they thought
at first this was because the Germans had not yet
seen them. They themselves were on a slightly
elevated portion of ground, and over the Germans’
parapet could see the men standing about,
but making no move to stop them.</p>

<p>The boys did not stop to figure out the reason
for this, however, but raced toward the position,
and with shouts of triumph climbed over the
pile of stones and sand bags. They were on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the point of falling savagely on the Germans,
when suddenly Tom exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There’s no use wasting ammunition on these
fellows. They’re about as dead as they can be,
already.”</p>

<p>And it was indeed as Tom said. Caught, probably,
by the gas from a bursting poison shell, they
had died as they stood, and, leaning against the
barricade, most of them had remained in a standing
position, although two or three lay stretched
out on the ground.</p>

<p>“We had our worry for nothing, here,” observed
Frank, “although we took the position,
and that’s about all anyone can do, after all.”</p>

<p>The boys had outstripped all their companions,
so they took a brief breathing spell while they
were waiting for the others to come up. Soon
they could see their comrades approaching, and
at the same time a machine gun about a hundred
feet to their right, of whose presence they had not
been aware up to this time, started in a savage
fusillade against the approaching boys in khaki.</p>

<p>“We’ll put a stop to that!” exclaimed Frank,
and, as the others caught his meaning, all
leaped to the German machine gun, and in a
few seconds had it trained on the enemy. The
Hun position was only lightly defended on the
sides, and the machine gun projectiles bored
through these, and wrought instant execution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
among the startled Germans. The fire from
their machine gun died out, and the boys knew
that here was one more menace disposed of. The
Americans, with this handicap removed, rushed
forward with cheers, and soon the three friends
were surrounded by their comrades in arms.</p>

<p>The line pushed forward again, the places of
those falling being taken by others eager to get
their chance at the hated Boche. Machine gun
after machine gun was taken, and trench after
trench cleared out, but the defenses were so elaborate
and so numerous that progress was at times
heartbreakingly slow. Shells from the American
batteries in the rear fell constantly before
them, helping somewhat to clear the ground, but
still leaving much to be done by the infantry.
About the middle of the afternoon a halt was
called, the Americans crouching in captured
trenches for a brief period of recuperation.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Billy, “I may be all wrong,
fellows, but just the same I have a feeling that
the Boches don’t want us to capture the Argonne
Forest. Don’t know what gives me that feeling,
but I’ve got it all the same.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have wonderful powers of observation,”
said Frank, dryly. “But come to
think of it, I shouldn’t wonder if you were right.
But before we get through with them they’ll wish
they had made us a present of it in the first place,
and saved themselves a bad licking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Maybe—” started Tom, but he was cut short
by the command to resume the advance.</p>

<p>The Americans leaped from the trench and
with a lusty cheer pressed onward. But the Germans
had a most unpleasant surprise in store for
them. As they approached one trench, instead
of bullets, streams of searing fire came shooting
toward them.</p>

<p>The Americans knew that this was the dreaded
“liquid fire” that they had heard about, but up to
now had never actually experienced. However,
they knew that the trench had been captured, and
so, shielding their faces as well as they could with
their arms, they dashed forward, throwing hand
grenades as they ran. The liquid fire only
reached a distance of about a hundred feet, which
made their task a little easier, cutting down the
distance they had to go in the face of this obstacle
to reach the trench.</p>

<p>This liquid fire was one of the most infernal of
the German inventions. The soldier operating it
had on his back a bag containing the necessary
chemicals, connected to a short length of hose
with a narrow nozzle. When the chemicals contained
in the bag combined, they formed a high
pressure and as the chemical stream left the
nozzle it burst into flame. The pressure was
sufficient to carry it a considerable distance, and
the acid seared and ate into any object with which
it came into contact. It was one of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
dreaded of modern instruments of war, and it
took the highest form of courage to face it.</p>

<p>But it was just that kind of courage that distinguished
the American Army, and with shouts
and cries of encouragement the American soldiers
leaped forward. Their hand grenades took
instant effect, for almost at once the number of
streams turned on them lessened, but there were
still plenty left to make it exciting and hazardous
work.</p>

<p>Crouching almost double, the Americans
dashed forward through this shower of death,
and at last leaped into the German trenches. Then
their heavy revolvers came into play, and the
tables were quickly turned. In a very few minutes
the remaining Boches threw up their hands
and cried for quarter. A number were taken
prisoners, but the majority had made their last
accounting.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Frank, when he had recovered
his breath. “That’s the first time I ever
bumped up against that stuff, and I sure hope
it’s the last. I’m willing to take my chance
against bullets, but that chemical fire is a little
too much to suit me.”</p>

<p>“It came near getting me,” said Billy. “Just
take a look at my coat, will you?”</p>

<p>They looked, and uttered exclamations of astonishment.
The entire front of Billy’s coat was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
eaten away, with blackened edges for all the
world as if it had been burned by ordinary fire.</p>

<p>“You’re pretty lucky to have gotten off as easy
as that,” said Frank, soberly. “Uncle Sam will
give you a new coat. Some of the poor fellows
have been horribly burned,” and he indicated a
number of stretcher bearers who were slowly carrying
their burdens to the rear.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I can’t kick,” agreed Billy. “Just
make out we won’t have something to tell Bart
when we see him again. He’ll certainly be sore
at having to miss all this.”</p>

<p>“He sure will,” agreed Frank, “he’ll never get
over not being with us on this drive.”</p>

<p>“Let’s investigate one of these flame throwing
machines,” proposed Frank. “It looks as though
we might be here a little while, and I’m curious to
see what the things look like.”</p>

<p>His companions readily acceded to his proposal,
and stripped one of the machines from a
dead German, and were soon familiar with its
main features. They did not have time to make
a very thorough examination, however, for the
word to resume the advance was shortly passed
down the line, and they resumed the drive.</p>

<p>From that time on the going was a little easier,
and they made satisfactory progress, inflicting
great losses on the Germans, and losing only a
comparatively small number of men themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Toward nightfall, the rain, which had held off all
day, began to fall heavily, and this soon put an
end to the advance for that day, as they were already
far beyond the point they had expected to
reach.</p>

<p>It was a thoroughly weary but nevertheless
cheerful and triumphant lot of young Americans
who made camp that night, for they had the consciousness
of obstacles overcome and difficult
work well done that made their bodily weariness
seem a thing of small account.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>BEATING THE HUNS TO THEIR KNEES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hurrah!</span>” cried Frank, as he came running
up to his comrades in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“The jig’s up,” returned Frank.</p>

<p>“Whose jig?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“The Huns’, you boob,” Frank replied exultantly.
“They’ve come to the end of their string.
They’re down and out—kerflummexed—<i>ausgespielt</i>—and
if there’s anything worse than that
they’re that.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Billy, “come down to earth and
tell us what you mean. Talk to us in plain English,
so that our simple minds can take it in.”</p>

<p>“Simple is right,” grinned Frank. “Well, then,
here goes. The Huns have applied for an armistice.
They’ve thrown up the sponge. They want
to quit and they say so.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Tom. “So they’ve got enough
of it at last. We’ve hammered them into pulp.”</p>

<p>“I knew we’d bring them to their knees,” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Billy jubilantly. “Their goose was
cooked when the Yanks got into the fight. But
how do you know? Where did you get the
news?”</p>

<p>“I heard the major talking with the captain
about it,” replied Frank. “I was sitting on a log
cleaning my gun, and they came along and
stopped to chin close to where I was. I got an
earful of all that’s been going on for the last two
or three weeks. It seems that the high mucka-mucks
in Berlin have been reading the handwriting
on the wall, and it’s been giving them the
shivers. First Bulgaria caved in, then Turkey
followed suit. Both of them have surrendered
and are out of the war. Austria took a last
chance and the Italians have smashed her to bits
and captured five hundred thousand men.”</p>

<p>The boys gasped.</p>

<p>“You’re kidding us,” protested Billy.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” denied Frank. “I’m giving it
to you straight. They’ve just gone down one
after the other like a row of dominoes. And
now Germany has made up her mind that she’ll
have to eat crow, too. The Huns sent a letter to
President Wilson asking him to take steps toward
giving them an armistice.”</p>

<p>“Armistice,” echoed Tom a little doubtfully.
“I don’t exactly like the sound of that. It means
that we shall stop fighting for a while. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
should we? That would only give Heinie a
chance to get his breath and start in fresh again.
We’ve got him on the run now, and we ought to
keep it up until we send him hotfoot over the
Rhine.”</p>

<p>“Wait now,” said Frank. “I’m not through
yet. Likely enough Heinie had that in mind.
He’s got everything to gain by getting a rest, and
we’ve got everything to lose. But if that was
one of his cute little tricks, he didn’t get away
with it. The President wrote back asking some
awkward questions that put Heinie in a hole.
There were two or three other notes, but the upshot
of it all was that the Huns were told to
apply to Marshal Foch and he would tell them
where they got off. Of course it wasn’t put in
that way, but that’s the sense of it. They’ve got
to send to the Marshal and beg him to stop licking
them. In other words, they’ll have to admit
defeat and sue for peace on the best terms they
can get.”</p>

<p>“But will they do it?” asked Billy. “They’ve
still got a big army and a big fleet. You’d think
they’d stick it out a bit longer in the hope that
things might take a different turn.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Frank. “The English would.
The French would. The Americans would. But
the baby-killers wouldn’t. They’re like all bullies.
The stuff isn’t there. When the pinch comes they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
curl up. They’re ready to quit right now, and in
a few days you’ll hear they’ve done it.”</p>

<p>“It listens good,” said Tom, “and of course in
one way it’s fine. But after what I’ve seen of the
things they’ve done to France, it seems as though
they were getting off too easy. They ought to
have their own towns and cities devastated, their
orchards cut down, their mills blown up and their
coal mines flooded. Then they’d get a taste of
what they’ve been doing to others.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Billy. “But don’t think
they’re not going to pay for everything they’ve
done. They’ll be stripped to the bone and don’t
you forget it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so,” said Tom, but with not
much assurance. “I’d rather take it from them
now and make sure of it. Nobody knows what
will happen when those fellows get together and
begin to bargain. They may throw away all the
results of the war for all we can tell. It’s happened
more than once that the party that’s been
licked on the field has got off almost scot free, if
not actually gaining, when the peace treaty came
to be signed.”</p>

<p>“Well, you old croaker,” laughed Frank,
“we’ll have to leave all that to the diplomats and
take our chances on their not letting the Huns put
anything over on them. In the meantime, all
we’ve got to do is to fight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ours not to make reply,</div>
<div class="verse">Ours not to reason why,</div>
<div class="verse">Ours but to do and die,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>chanted Billy.</p>

<p>But with all his doubts, Tom went on with the
fighting with renewed inspiration at the news
that victory was near at hand. And his friends
were filled with rejoicing that the Huns were
being beaten to their knees and were about ready
to acknowledge it. Their tremendous exertions
and sacrifices in leaving America and coming
across the sea to fight for liberty and civilization
against brutality and barbarism had not been in
vain. They felt something the way the Crusaders
must have felt when they caught sight of Jerusalem,
the goal of their endeavors.</p>

<p>And now the work of the last two weeks began
to tell. The enemy resistance began to grow
feebler, though he still hung on desperately and
tried by stubborn rear-guard actions to hold these
persistent Americans back. But the worst part
of the forest had been cleared. The whole place
had been a vast fortress. Above the ground every
possible natural and artificial obstruction had
been put in their path, and had had to be conquered
one by one. Beneath the ground it had
been like the Catacombs of Rome. There were
subterranean passages, bombproof shelters, railways,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
communicating trenches, cunning traps, a
thousand devices that the Germans had been four
years in perfecting. But none of these had
thwarted American ingenuity and American
courage. And as the enemy saw how fruitless
their endeavors were, their confidence melted
away and began to give place to panic. Nothing
could stop these Americans. What was the use
of trying?</p>

<p>So the work grew easier for the Army Boys.
They advanced faster and faster. They had got
through the worst part of their task and were
reaching the higher and clearer ground where
tanks could operate more readily. Armored
trucks and lorries were loaded with men and were
sent forward in the direction of Stenay and
Sedan. More prisoners were being brought in
every day.</p>

<p>The big naval guns that had been brought over
in sections by Plunkett’s men were beginning now
to demonstrate their value. They outranged anything
the Germans had. They threw projectiles
that weighed fourteen hundred pounds a distance
of from fifteen to twenty miles and they were
concentrated now on the railway line from Mezieres
to Sedan that was the Germans’ last hope
either for supplies or retreat. The end was coming
and coming fast, and the Army Boys were
jubilant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>They were pressing forward in this mood one
afternoon when they found themselves held up
by an especially stubborn machine gun nest. It
commanded a position that was the key of the
German defense in that section and the Germans
were putting forth herculean efforts to hold it.</p>

<p>It was useless to try to take it from in front,
for a storm of bullets swept the road along which
nothing could advance and live.</p>

<p>Corporal Wilson was given a squad of men,
among whom were Frank, Billy and Tom, and
commanded to silence the position.</p>

<p>They made a wide detour, worming their way
along on both sides of the nest, and then at a
given signal rushed the position. The startled
gun crew turned their gun first one way and then
the other in an attempt to check their assailants,
but although some fell dead or wounded, the survivors
reached their goal, leaped upon the gunners
and bayoneted them at their posts.</p>

<p>“Gee, but that was a hot scrap!” panted Frank,
as the last of the enemy went down.</p>

<p>“You bet it was,” agreed Billy, “and we’ve had
to pay for it too. We’ve lost several of our fellows.
Poor Milt Barlow was toppled over and
Fred Anderson got a bullet in his shoulder.”</p>

<p>“This was a regular fort,” commented Tom, as
he looked about him. “Look at that pile of cartridges.
There’s thousands of rounds there. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
far as bullets were concerned, those fellows could
have held out all day.”</p>

<p>“The Heinies certainly wanted to hold it,” said
Billy, “and I shouldn’t wonder if they tried to
retake it.”</p>

<p>“Here comes a bunch of them now,” said
Frank, as he looked in the direction of the German
lines. “And they’re opening up with artillery
too,” he added, as a shell came screaming
through the air and exploded with a thunderous
roar not fifty feet away.</p>

<p>A crackling rifle fire followed the shell, and a
bullet ploughed through the scalp of the corporal,
knocking him senseless.</p>

<p>There was no other officer at hand and Frank
took command at once. His quick eye glancing
about caught sight of a disabled and abandoned
tank that was near by. It lay in such a position
that its open door was on the side that faced the
enemy.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he ordered. “Put the machine gun
in that tank. Hurry now and bring all that ammunition
along. But first put the corporal behind
that tree where a bullet can’t get him.
Hustle’s the word.”</p>

<p>There was need for haste, for a body of the
enemy that outnumbered them ten to one was approaching
on the double quick. In a trice the
wounded corporal was laid behind a tree in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
position of comparative safety, the gun was transported
to the tank, together with the ammunition,
and the little party was ready for the attack.
Frank, Billy and Tom were crowded inside the
tank with the gun, while four others lay down
behind it in reserve, ready to take the place of
any of the crew who might be killed or wounded.</p>

<p>Crouching as closely in the tank as he could,
Frank slewed the gun around in the direction of
the enemy and sent a hail of bullets against the
advancing ranks.</p>

<p>Men were seen to stagger and fall, but their
places were taken by others and the Germans continued
to come on. But that stream of fire kept
up remorselessly, and at last the wave of attackers
faltered, broke and fled.</p>

<p>“They’re running!” cried Billy exultantly.</p>

<p>“A lot of them will never run again,” said
Tom grimly, as he continued feeding the gun that
Frank was aiming.</p>

<p>“They’ll be back,” prophesied Frank, for he
could see the enemy in the shelter of the woods
trying to reform. “This place is too important
to give it up without another try. How’s the
ammunition holding out?”</p>

<p>“Plenty yet,” replied Billy. “There must be a
thousand rounds. And the best of it is that
they’re German bullets out of a German gun that
we’re feeding to Fritz.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Shows how honest we are,” chuckled Tom.
“We’re giving him all that belongs to him. And
we’re giving it to him too with compound interest.”</p>

<p>Once more the Germans came on, only to be
mowed down like corn before the reaper. The
boys had thrown off all their upper garments now
and were stripped to the waist, for the confined
quarters of the tank and the heat of the firing
were causing the perspiration to run down their
faces and bodies in streams.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom gave a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“The gun’s getting too hot!” he exclaimed.
“It blisters you when you touch it. We’ll have
to give it a rest and let it cool off.”</p>

<p>“Rest nothing,” declared Frank, as he saw that
the Germans were trying to advance. “They’d
be on us before we’d be ready to fire again.
Quick, you fellows, get your canteens and pour
the water into the cooler of the gun. That’ll keep
it going so that we can use it.”</p>

<p>In a twinkling his comrades obeyed, and every
drop that their canteens contained was emptied
into the cooler. The result was apparent at once,
and the gun continued its deadly work without
interruption.</p>

<p>But now the Germans had brought up a field-piece
and placed it in position where it had a good
target in the tank, and shells began to fall thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and fast in the vicinity of their temporary fort.
It was evidently only a matter of time before one
of them would strike it and put it out of business.</p>

<p>“Getting pretty hot,” muttered Frank, as one
shell fell within twenty feet and a great volume
of smoke and dirt rolled over them.</p>

<p>“Can’t you pick off the gunners, Frank?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to,” answered Frank, “but the bullets
fall short. Those fellows are too far out of
range.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, there was a roar that almost split
their eardrums and a shell exploded within a few
feet of the tank. It dug a great crater under one
edge of the tank which began to topple ominously.</p>

<p>“Jump!” shouted Frank, and they leaped out
just as the tank lurched over and tumbled into
the hole.</p>

<p>They were just in time, for in another instant
the monster would have carried them with it and
probably caught them beneath its weight. As it
was, Tom’s leg was badly scraped by one of the
edges as it passed him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Germans sent up a triumphant shout as
they saw the tank go over, and a large detachment
came rushing out of the woods. But by the
time they had advanced a few yards, Frank and
his squad grabbed their rifles, and, crouching behind
what shelter they could find, sent a volley of
bullets into the enemy ranks.</p>

<p>It was a critical position for the little group of
Americans. The enemy at that special point outnumbered
them, and military prudence would
have dictated a retreat. But their fighting blood
was up and their rifles still held several bullets
each. They would at least empty these into the
enemy ranks before they fell back. Then, too,
there was the corporal, who had as yet given no
sign of consciousness. The boys could not think
of leaving him to be captured by the foe.</p>

<p>Moreover, the position was an important one,
as was shown by the frantic eagerness of the Germans
to regain it. All things considered, Frank
determined to hold the ground to the death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“They’ll have to pay dearly for this place if
they get it,” he muttered between his clenched
teeth as he disposed his little band to the best advantage.
“Don’t waste your bullets, boys. Take
aim and make every one of them tell.”</p>

<p>“Righto,” responded Tom, as cool as a cucumber,
as he took careful aim and saw a German
throw up his hands and fall. “There’s one
less to bother about.”</p>

<p>The others followed his example, and their
bullets did stern execution, so much so that the
Germans had an impression that they were faced
by a much larger detachment than was really
there. They hesitated and sought shelter behind
trees while their officers conferred.</p>

<p>“Heinie thinks he’s bitten off more than he can
chew,” chuckled Billy, as the little squad took
advantage of the respite to reload their rifles.</p>

<p>“I guess the whole German army has had that
impression for some time,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“Don’t kid yourselves,” warned Frank. “This
is only a breathing spell. This position may
come high, but they have to have it, and you’ll see
them coming on again in a minute.”</p>

<p>The words had scarcely fallen from his lips
before the Germans appeared, with all their losses
made up by the addition of new units, and came
rushing toward them with an officer at their head,
waving his revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Something new for Heinie,” muttered Frank,
as his eye ran along the stock of his rifle. “The
officers usually send their men forward while
they themselves stay in the rear.”</p>

<p>His rifle spoke and the officer plunged forward
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Good shooting,” commended Billy, as a bullet
from his gun also found its mark.</p>

<p>But this time the Germans were bound on winning
through, and they came on with determination.
The distance between the two forces lessened
to a hundred feet, then to eighty, then to
fifty. The Army Boys pumped lead into the
enemy ranks as fast as their fingers could pull
the trigger and the German loss was heavy, but
still they kept on.</p>

<p>“Fix bayonets,” commanded Frank, his eyes
blazing, as the line got within thirty feet of him.
“When I give the word, follow me.”</p>

<p>Another moment passed.</p>

<p>“Forward!” shouted Frank, and the next instant
he sprang forward with leveled bayonet,
with his devoted little band close on his heels.</p>

<p>There was a shout and a volley from the Germans
and two of Frank’s men fell wounded, but
the rest kept on and in another second they were
in the midst of the German ranks and giving them
the bayonet.</p>

<p>Stabbing and hacking, they hewed their way
into the mass. And just at that moment there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
was a great cheer behind them and a company of
the old Thirty-seventh with Captain Baker at
their head came pounding along and threw themselves
into the fight.</p>

<p>The tables had turned and turned with a vengeance,
and now it was the Germans who were
outnumbered. They were already disconcerted
by the savageness of Frank’s attack and the coming
of the new foe threw them into a panic. They
put up a show of resistance, but this soon vanished,
and they broke and fled, pursued by the
Americans who did not pause in the work until
they had rounded up the greater portion of the
fleeing enemy as prisoners.</p>

<p>The captain congratulated Frank and his comrades
warmly for their gallant stand, but there
was little time for talk, for much remained to be
done. The prisoners were sent to the rear and
the wounded were gathered up and taken away
to an advanced dressing station. The corporal,
they were glad to be told, was not fatally
wounded, although he would probably be in the
hospital for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>“That means that he’s probably fired his last
shot at a Hun,” remarked Frank. “By the time
he comes out it will be all over but the shouting.”</p>

<p>“Come out of your dream,” said Tom, who
could never see what he thought was a bubble
without a desire to stick a pin in it. “We’re a
long way yet from the Rhine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“But we’re getting nearer all the time,” chimed
in Billy. “I’ll bet we’ll be sailing on it before
Christmas.”</p>

<p>“And listening to the Lorelei singing,” grinned
Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Billy, “but it’ll be a different
song from the one she’s used to. Instead of
<i>Die Wacht am Rhein</i> she’ll be singing the Marseillaise
and the Star Spangled Banner. I’ll bet
she’s practicing up on it now so as to be ready
for us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what brand of dope you fellows
are using,” protested Tom, “but whatever it is I’d
advise you to change it.”</p>

<p>But his comrades were better prophets than
Tom was willing to admit, for that very night
Frank had an interview with Colonel Pavet that
changed his hopes into a certainty.</p>

<p>The colonel was coming out of headquarters
when he recognized Frank, who was on sentry
duty near by. The colonel came to Frank at
once with his usual cordial greeting.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have heard the news,” he said.</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank. “What is it Colonel?”</p>

<p>“The German delegates are coming to meet
Marshal Foch,” smiled the French officer, whose
exultation appeared in his tones.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Frank delightedly. “They ought
to be coming on their knees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Well, it amounts to that,” laughed the French
colonel. “It means nothing less than surrender.
They have been the first to cry quits. They asked
your President to intercede with the Allies for
them, and he told them that they would have to
apply to Marshal Foch for terms. Ah, <i>mon ami</i>,
that was a bitter pill for the Germans to swallow.
But they swallowed it. The Marshal replied to
them that they would have to come to his headquarters
and he would tell them the terms on
which he would grant their plea. So the Germans
have appointed a commission to visit the
Marshal and they are on their way now. They
will reach our lines in an hour or two and then
they will be taken in charge by French officers,
blindfolded and conveyed to the Marshal’s presence.”</p>

<p>“And where is that?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is a military secret,” smiled the
colonel, shaking his finger in mock reproof. “The
Germans would have been very glad if they had
been able to find that out during the war. But
they’ll find it out soon enough now,” he added
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I’d give a good deal to see the interview,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“It would indeed be something to remember,”
agreed the colonel. “I would give some years of
my life if I could have that privilege myself. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
I ought not to complain, for I at least will be able
to see the opening scene of the great world play.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Frank with great interest.</p>

<p>“My regiment will be in charge of that part of
the French line where the German delegates will
first appear on their visit to the Marshal,” replied
the colonel. “Their route has been planned out
for them. The pleasant duty will devolve on me
of having them blindfolded and then sending
them on their journey under French escort. I
am on my way back to my regiment now in order
to have everything in readiness.”</p>

<p>“For a moment I could almost wish that I were
in your regiment,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“And I would only be too delighted if you
were,” returned the colonel. “The regiment holds
no braver man. But wait a moment,” he said,
as a thought struck him. “I will see what arrangements
I may be able to make.”</p>

<p>He went inside headquarters again and after a
few moments returned.</p>

<p>“I shall need a messenger,” he said, “to bring
back certain details to your commander. I had
at first intended to entrust that work to my orderly,
but what you said gave me a new idea. I
have asked your commander to let me take you
with me for that purpose and he has readily
agreed. You will be relieved from guard duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
and you can take my orderly’s horse and come
along with me. My regiment is not a great way
from yours, as our lines nearly touch, and you
can be back in your quarters by midnight.”</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand times!” said Frank
joyfully. “You have put me under a great obligation.”</p>

<p>“A mere trifle,” replied the colonel, waving the
thanks aside. “I can never forget that I owe my
life to you. You can join me here in a few minutes
and we will go on.”</p>

<p>The sergeant of the guard came up shortly and
relieved Frank, who hurried to his dugout to
make some hasty preparations and tell his friends
of his good fortune. They were overjoyed.</p>

<p>“Lucky dog,” remarked Billy, giving him a resounding
thump on the shoulder. “I only wish
that the colonel needed three messengers instead
of one so that we could all go along.”</p>

<p>“If you fell overboard, you wouldn’t get wet,”
chaffed Tom. “Give my best regards to the
Heinies when you see them and tell them how
sorry I am that they’ve got to eat crow.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget,” laughed Frank, as he shook
hands hurriedly and hastened off.</p>

<p>He found the colonel waiting for him. In a
moment Frank had mounted the orderly’s horse
and he and the colonel rode off together.</p>

<p>“By the way,” remarked the colonel, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
course of the conversation that ensued as they
rode side by side, “I heard from Andre two days
ago, and he said that things were not progressing
as favorably as he could hope in regard to the
De Latour property. Quite unexpectedly additional
obstacles have come up. I was not going
to bother you about this, for I knew you would
be greatly worried. But the war has changed
many things, and things in law are not so easy to
adjust as they were. I am still hoping that all
will come out right in the end. He, however,
expects that he will be able to have the title perfected
before Christmas, which is now less than
two months off. I know the delay is exasperating,
but that is to be expected in all legal affairs.
I thank the stars,” he added with a smile, “that I
was made a soldier instead of a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” returned Frank, “and yet
we couldn’t very well do without them, and I am
very thankful to your brother as well as yourself
for the kindness you have shown in trying to secure
my mother’s rights.”</p>

<p>Frank tried to speak lightly but he was forced
to heave a heavy sigh. There had been so many
delays in the past! Would his mother ever be
able to prove her claim to that property and really
take possession of it?</p>

<p>In a little while they had reached the French
lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“You see,” smiled the colonel, “that I was
right when I said it would be a race between us
to see who would get first to Sedan. We’ve kept
pretty well up with you, although your task has
been far the harder. Oh, you Americans! I’m
glad that you’re our friends instead of our enemies
as I should hate to have to face your soldiers
in the field.”</p>

<p>“We’ll never meet except as brothers in arms,”
returned Frank. “That’s what Washington and
Lafayette were, and our nations have been the
closest of friends ever since. The greatest republic
of the old world and the greatest of the
new have always stood and will always stand for
liberty and civilization.”</p>

<p>They soon reached the colonel’s quarters, and
the latter then confided Frank to the charge of a
young lieutenant, with instructions that he should
be given refreshments and be treated with every
courtesy and attention. The young fellow was
of about the same age as Frank, and was delighted
to find that the latter spoke French almost
as perfectly as himself. They were soon chatting
together like old friends.</p>

<p>Throughout the regiment there was an attitude
of solemnity and expectation. The men had been
told of what was coming and it had thrilled them
with a feeling too deep for words. They stood at
rest in the darkness, and few words were interchanged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Each was realizing that the end of the
four years of agony was in sight. France and
her Allies had won their fight. The brutal,
beastly power that had sought to drench the world
in tears and blood and sow it with graves had
been brought to its knees. Right had conquered.
Men could stand erect instead of crouching as
slaves. The would-be oppressor, cowed and cringing,
had come to beg for mercy.</p>

<p>Suddenly at a turn of the road a stream of
light flashed out, and there was a stir in the ranks.
The light came nearer, and it could be seen that
it came from a large automobile that was rapidly
approaching. Other cars followed and the landscape
was flooded with light.</p>

<p>But the thing that thrilled Frank to the marrow
was this:</p>

<p><i>Over every car floated a white flag.</i></p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>VICTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hun was beaten at last.</p>

<p>Those white flags meant surrender, defeat.</p>

<p>The bully of Europe was whipped.</p>

<p>Germany’s wild and wicked adventure was
ended. She had appealed to force and force had
answered her.</p>

<p>The pirate flag, the flag of the skull and crossbones,
had been hauled down. In its place was
the white flag that admitted defeat and sued for
terms.</p>

<p>The cars drove up to where Colonel Pavet and
his officers were standing. There they came to a
stop.</p>

<p>One by one, the German peace delegates descended
from the car. They were received with
cold and ceremonious politeness.</p>

<p>One of the men, the leader of the party, was in
civilian dress. The others were in military or
naval uniforms.</p>

<p>The formalities were soon over. They had
reached the French lines and from now on would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
be in the custody of French officers. One by one
the delegates were blindfolded, so that they might
gain no information of military importance as
they passed through the French lines. Then the
delegates were helped into their seats, the French
officers who were to accompany them gave the
signal, and the cars started off on their long journey
to the forest of Compiegne, where in a railroad
car, drawn up on a siding, there was waiting
for them the grave, stern soldier, whose genius
had struck a deathblow to the German cause just
when its prospects seemed brightest, and who had
kept hammering at the crumbling lines until the
end had come in the blackness of utter and absolute
defeat.</p>

<p>Frank drew a long breath as the last of the line
of cars faded from sight in the darkness. So
many sensations had come crowding in upon him
in the last few minutes that his brain was in a
whirl. He knew that he had been privileged to
see one of the most momentous happenings in the
history of the world.</p>

<p>So engrossed was he in his thoughts that it was
almost as in a dream that he exchanged cordial
greetings with Colonel Pavet and the young lieutenant
and started on his ride homeward. He
had anticipated a hilarious time in narrating
to Tom and Billy all he had felt and seen,
but he was really glad when he arrived at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
his quarters that they were sound asleep. Ordinarily
he would have wakened them without ceremony,
but just now he wanted to snuggle down in
his blanket and go over and over again in his
mind the events of that night of nights.</p>

<p>His first and controlling thought was that of
his country. Above everything else he was an
American through and through. He was proud
of his country, of its traditions, of its history, of
its glorious flag. For that flag he had risked his
life again and again. He loved it with a consuming
passion. Old Glory! The tears came to his
eyes as he thought of it. The flag that had always
stood for human freedom and human
rights, the flag that had never covered an ignoble
cause, the flag that had never been sullied by
stain, had never been smirched by defeat, had
never been dragged in the dust. Now once more
it was triumphant in the greatest war that had
ever been waged on earth. God bless it!</p>

<p>Later his thoughts took a more personal turn.
It meant that soon he would be back with that
dear mother of his whose love for him had kept
him clean and straight through all this terrible
conflict. He saw the little house in Camport,
embowered in roses, saw himself going back
there, saw his mother running to the gate to meet
him.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>In the morning he was his own jolly care-free
self again and it was well that he was, for he was
besieged with questions by his chums concerning
all the details of his experience.</p>

<p>“Well, you haughty diplomat,” was Billy’s
greeting, “have you settled the terms of the
armistice? Have you ordered the Kaiser to be
shot? Out with it, now.”</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” laughed Frank. “I was simply
a looker-on among a thousand others. But I
tell you what, fellows, it was something worth
looking at. It was something I sha’n’t forget as
long as I live.”</p>

<p>“I bet you won’t,” returned Tom. “How did
the Huns look?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t look as though they enjoyed it
much,” returned Frank. “In fact, they looked
very much like men who were going to be stood
up before a firing squad. One of them reached
out his hand to Colonel Pavet, but the colonel
was looking over his head just at that moment
and somehow failed to see it. He was very polite
though. You know the Frenchmen are great
sticklers when it comes to matters of etiquette
and form.”</p>

<p>“How long have the Heinies got to decide
whether they’ll sign the armistice or not?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“The colonel told me that they’d have three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
days,” answered Frank. “Let’s see, yesterday
was the seventh of November. Today’s the
eighth. They’ll get there some time this morning.
That will give them till the eleventh to
sign, next Monday morning.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they don’t sign it?” suggested Tom
gloomily.</p>

<p>“So much the worse for them then,” answered
Frank. “Instead of losing their boots and shirts
they’ll lose their hides as well. But they’ll sign
all right, never fear. The colonel says that
they’re running around in Berlin like wild men.
Ludendorff has resigned and the Kaiser has left
Berlin to go to the army headquarters at Spa for
protection. The Crown Prince is afraid to be
seen in the streets. You see the Heinies have
been fed up on lies so long that now they’re
learning they’re licked they’re going crazy. And
naturally they’re turning on the men who have
been lying to them. Oh, it’s quite a different
Berlin now from the one that hung out the flags
and rang the bells when they heard that the <i>Lusitania</i>
had been sunk and a lot of women and babies
drowned.”</p>

<p>“Well now <i>we’ve</i> got some news,” said Tom
with a sober face, “and it isn’t very good news
either.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Frank in quick alarm as
his thoughts turned instantly to his absent chum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
“Don’t tell me that anything has happened to
Bart.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t dead,” Billy hastened to explain.
“But he’s disappeared from the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Disappeared?” replied Frank in dismay.
“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Billy, “it seems that he has been
out of his head. You know he was delirious the
last time we saw him. Well, one of the fellows
who was in the hospital with him came back to
duty last night and told us that about three days
ago when the nurse’s back was turned, Bart
slipped out of a door or a window, and when the
nurse came back he wasn’t there. Nobody saw
him go and nobody has the least idea what has
become of him.”</p>

<p>Frank was unspeakably shocked by the news.
Bart had become to him little less than a brother
and the various experiences they had been
through together since they had been in the army
had strengthened and deepened this feeling.</p>

<p>“But what could have happened to him?” he
asked desperately. “What will become of him?
It’s horrible to think of his wandering around in
this forsaken stretch of country. He may wander
into the German lines and be shot or taken
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that,” said Billy soothingly.
“The chances are all against it. He’d have to pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
through our lines to do it and it’s dollars to
doughnuts that he couldn’t do it without being
seen. At any minute we may hear that he’s been
found and taken back to the hospital. At any
rate, we know that the wound he got didn’t kill
him and while there’s life there’s hope.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom, who for once felt that it was
up to him to look on the bright side of things in
view of his friend’s evident distress, “Bart’s
worth a dozen dead men yet. Think how many
things he’s been through and yet turned up as
right as a trivet. Keep up your spirits and hope
for the best.”</p>

<p>They spoke with a confidence that they were
far from feeling, for they knew what they refrained
from telling Frank that a most careful
search had already been made without disclosing
the slightest trace of Bart’s whereabouts.</p>

<p>Frank was badly shaken by the news he had
heard and it was fortunate for him that the work
that yet lay before the army was such as to engross
his mind and keep him from brooding.</p>

<p>For the Allied commanders were taking no
chances. They knew too much of German duplicity
to rely on their good faith in any matter.
The nation that regarded solemn treaties as
“scraps of paper” was not to be trusted in the
slightest particular. Only when the mad dog of
Europe should be finally tied and muzzled could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the Allies afford to relax their efforts in any degree.</p>

<p>So the word had gone forth that for the next
three days the fighting should be pushed as sternly
and unrelentingly as ever.</p>

<p>The Germans on their side had an especial reason
to make as good a showing as possible while
the terms were being debated. If they could
show that they were further from collapse than
the Allies had supposed, the latter might be willing
to moderate their demands.</p>

<p>So for three days more the fighting continued
with unabated bitterness. And the Allies were
not to be denied. In every part of the wide-flung
battle line they kept on winning. And in the
Argonne and on the Meuse, where the Americans
were winding up their task, those days marked a
succession of victories. The war was ending in
a blaze of glory for the forces of civilization.</p>

<p>Monday morning came at last, the 11th of November,
1918, when the whole world was listening
for news. And the news came. It sped
across the ocean cables, it flashed through the air
by wireless, it set the bells ringing and the
whistles shrieking in every part of the Allied
world, it sent the people of Paris and London and
Rome and New York into the streets in thankful
and rejoicing throngs, it thrilled both hemispheres
and all the continents. Only in the capitals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
of the Central Powers did it sound like the
knell of doom.</p>

<p>It came, too, to the battlefronts, came in a
clarion note of bugles that woke the men from
sleep.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Tom sleepily.</p>

<p>“It’s too early for reveille,” grumbled Billy.</p>

<p>“Wake up, you boobs!” cried Frank joyously.
“The armistice is signed! The war is over!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>ON TO THE RHINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would have been hard to analyze the feeling
of the Army Boys when the meaning of it all
dawned upon them.</p>

<p>Their first feeling was that of satisfaction at
work well done. Uncle Sam had sent them over
to finish the job. Well, they had finished it.</p>

<p>Their next sensation was that of delight at
having accomplished the downfall of the Huns.
They had saved the world from slavery to the
most brutal nation that the modern world had
known.</p>

<p>Then there was the feeling that at last they
could be free from the daily danger of wounds
and death. They had risked this freely and
gladly as long as it was necessary. Yet life was
sweet and they were young.</p>

<p>“I told you they’d sign,” exclaimed Frank as
he gave Tom a resounding thump on the back.
“Now what have you got to say for yourself, you
old croaker?”</p>

<p>“I’m the goat,” admitted Tom with a joyous
grin. “Josh all you like. I’m too happy to want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
to come back at you. But don’t forget,” he
added, as a thought struck him, “that they may
back out yet. They’re the greatest crawfishes on
earth.”</p>

<p>“Not a chance,” chimed in Billy. “They’re
down and out. Gee, wouldn’t you like to be in
little old Camport this minute? Can’t you see
them all out on the streets and the laughing and
the crying and the shaking hands and all the rest
of it?”</p>

<p>“Just wait till the old Thirty-seventh goes
swinging through the Camport streets,” gloated
Tom. “They’ll give us the town. Nothing will
be too good for us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll surely be It with a capital I,” agree
Frank happily. “If only good old Bart could be
with us,” he added, and a shadow came over his
face.</p>

<p>“That’s the one fly in the ointment,” admitted
Billy. “But he will be with us and don’t you forget
it. He’s liable to turn up any minute.”</p>

<p>“And now that the fighting is over, we may
have a chance to look for him ourselves,” put in
Tom. “It stands to reason he can’t be very far
from here. But now let’s go to chow. We ought
to have an extra good meal this morning with a
lot of victory sauce to season it.”</p>

<p>They found the rest of the regiment as wildly
excited as they were themselves, and there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
perfect Babel of voices as the matter was discussed
in all its bearings.</p>

<p>“Look at the fellows’ faces,” chuckled Billy.
“They’re like so many full moons.”</p>

<p>“Rather different from what they were when
the Germans seemed to have the upper hand in
the Spring,” grinned Frank. “If anyone then
had told us that the Germans would have caved in
before Christmas, we’d have thought he was
crazy. But here it isn’t Thanksgiving yet and
they’ve cried quits.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there’ll be a little more fighting yet
this morning,” said Tom hopefully. “You know
the armistice doesn’t go into force until eleven
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Hear the glutton,” chaffed Frank. “He hasn’t
got enough fighting yet. He wants to get another
crack at the Hun.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there will be a show of fighting until
the last minute,” said Billy. “But I guess it will
be a matter of form. The artillery will open up
but they’ll fire wild. There’ll be just enough to
show that the army’s on the job.”</p>

<p>Billy was right. The morning wore away in a
desultory fashion, with every man looking at his
wrist watch every five minutes until eleven o’clock
approached. Then when the moment came, all
the big guns let go at once in one tremendous
salvo that seemed as though it would split the
heavens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>The war was over!</p>

<p>The silence that followed was the most curious
sensation that the Army Boys had known. Day
and night, the guns had been growling for
months, sometimes faintly, sometimes strongly,
but always growling. Now all along that vast
battle line of five hundred miles there was that
moment of blessed silence for which those millions
of men had been waiting and fighting. The
end of the long agony had come.</p>

<p>Frank, Billy, and Tom dropped their rifles and
looked at each other. Usually they were talkative
enough, but just now they were too full for
words.</p>

<p>Over the hill in front of them appeared a group
of German soldiers. They advanced a little, then
hung back, then advanced again, and made signs
that indicated that they wanted to talk with the
Americans. But they were waved sternly back.
The Americans wanted to have nothing to do
with them.</p>

<p>The strictest rules had been laid down by the
American officers that there was to be no fraternizing
with the enemy. While hostilities had
ceased, the war was still formally regarded as
being on until the actual treaty of peace was
signed. It might yet be necessary to take up
arms again, and the Americans were going to
take no chance of German propaganda getting in
its nefarious work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“A mighty good rule it is too,” commented
Frank, as he saw the discomfited Germans slink
back into their own lines. “If those fellows had
played the game fairly and gallantly as we played
it, I’d be the first one to shake hands with them
after the fighting was over and let bygones be bygones.
But there isn’t a decent rule of civilized
warfare that they haven’t violated. I’d as soon
shake hands with a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know a rattlesnake had hands,” gurgled
Billy, and dodged the pass that Frank made
at him.</p>

<p>“Well, now that the fighting is over, what’s the
next thing on the program?” asked Tom.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Where do we go from here, boys,</div>
<div class="verse">Where do we go from here?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>chanted Billy.</p>

<p>“That’s a question for our officers to settle,”
remarked Frank. “Of course we’ll all go back
to the good old U. S. A. eventually. At that, it
will be a tremendous job to get over two million
men back to the States. But I imagine a good
many of us will have to stay over here and do
police duty until the peace treaty is signed. Let’s
go down to the headquarters bulletin board and
see just what the armistice terms are. That may
give us a little light on the subject.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>The men had been given liberty now to leave
the ranks, and they found a great crowd gathered
about a number of bulletin boards where the
printed terms of the armistice had been posted.
So great was the throng that they found difficulty
in getting near the announcements.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Frank giving Tom a push.
“You’ve got gall enough to get in anywhere.
Buck the line and come back with the dope.”</p>

<p>Tom obeyed and wormed his way through the
crowd until he got a good view of a board. He
jotted down some of the main points and came
back with his eyes bulging.</p>

<p>“We’re going to the Rhine, fellows!” he exclaimed.
“We’re going to the Rhine!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE MARCH OF TRIUMPH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">How</span> do you know?” asked Frank, as he and
Billy made a grab for the piece of paper on which
Tom had jotted down his notes.</p>

<p>“Leave that alone,” said Tom, holding it out
of reach. “I had the work of getting this stuff
and I’m going to have the pleasure of telling you
the news.”</p>

<p>“Get busy then,” adjured Billy impatiently.</p>

<p>“Before I tell you anything else,” said Tom,
“listen to this: The Kaiser’s skipped.”</p>

<p>“What?” they exclaimed in chorus.</p>

<p>“Straight goods,” vowed Tom. “He ran away
like a cur. He didn’t even wait till the armistice
was signed. He struck out like a coyote for
Holland yesterday. He had a special train waiting
for him.”</p>

<p>“Yellow all through!” exclaimed Frank in disgust.</p>

<p>“He’s a hero—I don’t think,” remarked Billy.</p>

<p>“They say that the crowd in Holland guyed
him something awful while he was at the Eysden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
railroad station,” went on Tom. “Told him that
wasn’t the road to Paris and a lot of other little
things like that.”</p>

<p>“What’s become of the Clown Prince?” grinned
Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s skipped too, just the same as papa,”
laughed Tom. “They don’t know just yet where
he’s gone to, but he’s also among the missing.”</p>

<p>“They’re a precious pair,” grunted Billy. “But
it won’t do them any good. The Allies will get
after them yet and yank them out of their holes.”</p>

<p>“We’ll hope so,” said Frank. “I’d like to have
them both put in a cage and exhibited in every
city of the world. But let’s lay off his royal nibs
and get down to brass tacks. How do you know
we’re going to the Rhine?”</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly know that <i>we</i> are,” confessed
Tom. “But I do know that a big army of our
men are going, and it stands to reason that since
we’re the nearest to the Rhine, we’ll be in the
bunch. At any rate, even if our special regiment
isn’t going, I don’t think we’ll have any trouble in
taking the place of some of the others who would
rather go back to the States right away. Are you
game to go if we can make it? I am.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” ejaculated Billy.</p>

<p>“I am too,” said Frank a little more slowly.
“The only thing is that under other circumstances
I’d be anxious to get home on my mother’s account.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
But I’ve got to stay over here anyway
until her property affairs are all closed up. So
I’m with the rest of the bunch.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Tom and Billy in one breath.</p>

<p>“You see it’s this way,” went on Tom, referring
to his notes. “The Allies are going to occupy
all the German territory on this side of the
Rhine. Then in certain parts they’re going to
cross the Rhine. You see there are three great
crossings, one at Coblenz, one at Mayence and
another at Cologne. The Allies are going to occupy
a bridgehead eighteen miles in size on the
other side of the Rhine at these crossings.
That’ll cage up the Heinies so that they couldn’t
get back into France and Belgium even if they
wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Won’t they feel sore to have Allied soldiers
on the sacred soil of Germany!” grinned Billy.</p>

<p>“And have to take off their hats every time the
<i>Star Spangled Banner</i> is played,” laughed Frank.
“I tell you it will be a bitter pill for those fellows
to swallow.”</p>

<p>“It sure will,” agreed Tom. “But wait till you
hear the rest of the armistice terms. They’ve
surely made a thorough job of it. They’ve
taken away from Heinie everything except his
shirt, and he’ll have to borrow a barrel to go
home in.”</p>

<p>“Is it as bad as that?” chuckled Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Worse,” replied Tom. “Just listen to this
and judge for yourself. The Germans have got
to give up five thousand heavy and light field
guns, one thousand seven hundred airplanes, three
thousand trench mortars, thousands of machine
guns, all their submarines——”</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete!” interrupted Billy.</p>

<p>“All their submarines,” went on Tom, “ten of
the dreadnoughts, eight battle cruisers, six light
cruisers, fifty destroyers, five thousand locomotives,
one hundred and fifty thousand railroad
cars, and a lot more things that I didn’t have
time to jot down. But that will give you some
idea of what our victory means to us and what
defeat means to them. It hasn’t turned out a
very profitable thing for the fellows that set out
to loot the world, has it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it clinches the whole business anyway,”
remarked Frank. “It makes it impossible for
Germany to resume the war even if she wanted to,
and as far as that’s concerned, the armistice is
just as good as an actual treaty of peace.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed Billy. “I guess we’ve seen
our last fighting.”</p>

<p>“And it sure has been some fighting,” observed
Frank, as his thoughts went back over all
the events of the last few months. “It’s a miracle
that we’ve lived through it.”</p>

<p>“There have certainly been times when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
wouldn’t have given a plugged nickel for our
chances of coming out alive,” agreed Billy,
thoughtfully. “Oh, if only Bart was here to
celebrate with us.”</p>

<p>For the rest of that day they took the ease and
comfort that they had so richly earned. The
camp rules were relaxed and it was a general holiday.
They were conscious of an immense weariness
of body, as the reaction came from the strain
under which they had so constantly labored, but
their mental exhilaration was so great that they
were supremely happy. It was a curious experience
to be able to walk erect in perfect security,
without having to crouch behind a tree or a
trench or throw themselves to the ground at the
approach of a shell. It was a day of peace and
they enjoyed it beyond measure from the contrast
with the terrible days that had gone before.</p>

<p>But the next morning a stir ran through the
regiment. The old Thirty-seventh had been
chosen as one of the units of the Army of Occupation.
The news ran like wildfire through every
company and there was a furbishing of arms and
a rattle of harness and all the myriad sounds of a
regiment on the move.</p>

<p>“I told you we’d be chosen,” chortled Tom.
“When you’re looking for a prophet don’t pass
me by.”</p>

<p>“You hit the nail on the head all right,” admitted
Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Now we’ll relieve the Heinies from their task
of watching the Rhine,” laughed Frank. “From
this time on it will be strictly an American river.”</p>

<p>By noon of that day all preparations were completed.
The old Thirty-seventh took its place in
the line, the bands struck up, and with Old Glory
floating proudly overhead the long column swung
off toward the line of the German border.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>FRIENDS OR FOES?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Army Boys</span> marched on with light
hearts and swinging steps in the front rank of
their regiment. It was a perfect day, with just
enough snap in the crisp air to bring the blood to
their cheeks and make marching a delight. There
was no more fighting to be done, no batteries to
storm, no machine gun nests to be rooted out, no
more danger of maiming and death.</p>

<p>Despite this, however, there was no lack of
military precautions on the part of their officers.
Engineers went first to see that bridges were in
shape for crossing and to detect and explode hidden
mines before the main body of the troops
came along. There were also chemical experts
to test the water of the wells and see that they
were not defiled or poisoned. Such precautions
would have been unnecessary for some foes, but
the Americans knew with whom they had to deal.</p>

<p>Above the marching columns swayed a number
of observation balloons from which the observers
were able to see miles ahead of the troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and note how fast the enemy withdrew. Later
on, these were joined by a flock of airplanes.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the Germans should
withdraw keeping a certain number of miles
ahead of the advancing American troops. For
the sake of avoiding any unfortunate clashes,
this distance was enough as a rule to keep the opposing
forces out of sight of each other, but at
times, when the American forces mounted a hill,
they could see in the distance a long line of German
soldiers wending their way in the direction
of the Rhine.</p>

<p>“Not the kind of home trip that they expected
to make,” grinned Tom. “They thought that
they’d strut into Germany with our scalps hanging
to their belts.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” laughed Frank. “I’ll bet right
now they’re telling each other that they really
licked us. They’re the greatest self-kidders in
existence. Their minds are cross-eyed. They
never see anything straight. You see if when
those fellows reach Germany the people don’t
come out to meet them as conquering heroes.
It’s a great system. You win when you lose.”</p>

<p>“They remind me of the story of the fellow
who boasted that he had kept the other fellow
down by firmly inserting his nose between his adversary’s
teeth,” chuckled Billy. “But look at
these fellows coming along the road in rags. By
Jove, they’re Americans too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“They’re prisoners, let loose by the Germans!”
exclaimed Frank. “And look at their faces!
They’re nothing but skin and bones! That’s
what the Germans have done to them.”</p>

<p>The poor fellows in question were gathered in
at once and given food and medical attention.
They had harrowing tales to tell of their experiences
in German prison pens, of hunger and
brutality and abuse that made the blood of their
hearers boil.</p>

<p>“And to think of the way we fattened up the
prisoners that were in our hands!” exclaimed
Tom bitterly. “When I look at these poor fellows
it makes me sorry the war is over. I’d like
to get just one more crack at the Huns.”</p>

<p>The men had been turned out without food or
sufficient clothing that morning or the day before
to find their way back to their lines as best they
might. They were met in increasing numbers as
the lines advanced and it was lucky for the Germans
that the army that looked on these sights
did not have the fixing of the terms of the peace
treaty in their hands.</p>

<p>They camped that night in a little village from
which the Germans had withdrawn only a little
while before. The inhabitants were all out in
the streets to meet them with tears of joy running
down their faces as they welcomed their deliverers.
For four years they had been under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
the harsh and pitiless rule of the invaders, and
their joy now bordered on frenzy. They had
drawn out from their hiding places the French
flags that they had treasured through all that four
years of slavery and now they waved from every
window.</p>

<p>The band struck up the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i>
and every hat was lifted. Then suddenly, at a
signal from the leader, the band swung into the
Marseillaise. Then the scene beggared description.
How long it had been since these French
people had heard those glorious strains! How
often in those weary years they had despaired of
ever hearing them again! From grown men to
children, the whole population was sobbing. They
grasped the hands of the soldiers and tried to kiss
them.</p>

<p>The emotion was contagious, and most of the
husky doughboys felt a strange dampness about
their eyes.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, when he could trust himself
to speak, “just this one thing, if nothing else,
would pay me for whatever I’ve done or suffered
since I came to France.”</p>

<p>And this experience was paralleled in every
French town through which they passed. Everywhere
it was the same story of oppression, of robbery,
of slavery, of men deported against all the
laws of war to toil in German fields or factories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of girls torn from the arms of shrieking mothers
and carried off, never to be seen or heard of
again, of cruelty just for the sake of cruelty.
And now that the Germans had been driven out
in ignominy and defeat, these stalwart young
Americans who had helped so largely to compass
that defeat were looked upon almost in the light
of demi-gods. Nothing was too good for them,
although the scanty means of the people were
pathetically small. Attentions were showered
upon them. Little school children stood in rows
and shyly held out bouquets of flowers. A hideous
nightmare had been lifted from the land.</p>

<p>The plan of the advance called for two days
of marching and then two days of rest. Everything
moved with military precision and the
schedule was strictly maintained. Now and then
they saw some Germans in uniform, but these
were members of the medical corps who had been
left behind, by agreement with the Allies, to take
care of such German wounded as could not be
moved. At other times, a car would drive up
with some group of German officers who found
it necessary to consult with the American officers
about some matter connected with the fulfilment
of the terms of armistice. But in general, that
hated field gray uniform was conspicuous by its
absence.</p>

<p>Soon the Americans had crossed the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
border and reached the province of Luxemburg.
Here there was a grand review of the troops.
The Grand Duchess of Luxemburg stood on a
balcony of the palace in company with General
Pershing and received the salutes of the soldiers
as they marched past. It was a beautiful city,
and the Army Boys were not sorry when they
learned that they were to stay there for two days
before resuming their march.</p>

<p>“It’ll seem good to get out from a tent and
sleep under a roof again,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ve rather got fed up with tent life myself,”
agreed Billy. “I wonder where they’re going to
put us up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care much,” observed Tom, “provided
that the beds are clean and the grub is good.”</p>

<p>On consulting their billet they found that they
had been assigned to a house in the suburbs of
the town. They had little difficulty in finding
it, and were pleased to see that the house was a
substantial one, where the food and beds on
which Tom had laid stress were likely to be good.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they talk English?” said Frank,
as they rang the bell.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter much whether they do or
not,” replied Tom. “I’m pretty good at the sign
language when it comes to getting something to
eat. You’ll notice that I didn’t go hungry in
Paris.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>The door was opened by a maid, who ushered
them into a pleasant and tastefully decorated living
room, while she took the billet to her mistress.</p>

<p>While they were waiting for the latter to appear,
two young girls passed the living room door.
One was a brunette and the other of a blonde
type, but both were undeniably pretty. They evidently
had not been apprised of the presence of
strangers in the house, for when they caught sight
of the boys in uniform they seemed slightly startled
and hurried up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Peaches!” murmured Tom when they were
out of earshot.</p>

<p>“They’re not hard to look at,” agreed Frank
carelessly.</p>

<p>“And we’re only going to stay here two days,”
mourned Billy. “Hardly time enough to get acquainted.
I hope they’re able to talk English.”</p>

<p>“Frank’s got a chance in two languages,” said
Tom enviously. “He always was a lucky dog.”</p>

<p>Their chaffing was interrupted by the entrance
of their hostess. Frank acted as spokesman of
the party and spoke in French, as he thought he
would be more likely to be understood. But he
was surprised and somewhat disconcerted when
the lady told him in perfect English that she did
not understand French, and looked appealingly
to Tom and Billy. Frank changed at once into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
his native tongue, with a laughing explanation,
and the conversation soon grew easy and unconstrained.
Their new hostess stated that her name
was Edsall and that she was a widow. Her family
consisted of two daughters, Helen and Alice,
and her father, who was infirm and advanced in
years. The family was American but had been
residing abroad for years. She would be glad to
make their stay as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>She called the servant and had them shown to
their rooms which they found pleasant and well
furnished. They spent an unusual amount of
time on brushing up, and it would not have required
a very shrewd guess to determine that this
special care was not without reference to the two
pretty girls whom they knew they were to meet
at table.</p>

<p>When they were summoned to supper, they
found all the members of the family assembled
in the dining room. They were introduced to
the girls and to the old father. The latter had a
worried look in his sunken eyes, and kept muttering
to himself at times in a way that made the
boys feel that he was not altogether right in his
mind, and this made them think of the missing
Bart.</p>

<p>The supper was good and well served, and they
were soon chatting pleasantly together. Tom
was especially attentive to Alice, the brunette,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
while Billy devoted himself to her blonde sister,
Helen. Frank made himself generally agreeable,
chatting with his hostess and occasionally addressing
himself to the old man. The latter
would arouse himself and make some reply which
showed that he had not fully grasped what Frank
had been saying. Then he would relapse into his
moody muttering, and Frank, for fear of embarrassing
him, finally left him to himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly something that Helen was saying to
Billy caught Frank’s attention.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she remarked, “when we were living in
Coblenz—”</p>

<p>“Coblenz!” ejaculated Billy. “Why that’s in
Germany!”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she replied in some wonderment.
“Why, what of it?”</p>

<p>Frank caught a warning look that her mother
directed at Helen.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>A PERPLEXING QUESTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Why</span>, nothing,” stammered Billy, a trifle embarrassed.
“I didn’t know that you had ever
been in Germany.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t mother tell you?” asked Helen. “We
lived in Coblenz for years.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Edsall intervened.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mention it,” she said quietly, “because
it is a matter of no importance. Yes, we did live
in Germany for some years before the war broke
out. My father had come over from America
to take charge of a branch importing house at
Coblenz. My husband had died, and we came
with my father. When the war started, or rather
when we saw that it was about to begin, we left
Germany and came here, where we have lived
ever since.”</p>

<p>She changed the subject then and the conversation
went on, but it was now constrained and formal.
From time to time the boys shot a glance
at each other that was full of interrogation. And
as soon as the meal was finished, they excused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
themselves and went to Frank’s room where they
were soon in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” asked Tom in
much perplexity.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think,” confessed
Frank. “It may be all right and it may be all
wrong. But one thing’s certain, and that is that
we’ve got to be on our guard. Those infernal
Germans have spies everywhere and we may be in
a nest of them. We want to keep as mum as oysters
about all military affairs.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem as though a nice girl like that
Helen could be a spy,” said Billy regretfully.</p>

<p>“Nor Alice,” put in Tom.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re not,” admitted Frank. “In
fact, I’m pretty sure they’re not, or Helen
wouldn’t have made that break about living in
Coblenz. It’s the last thing they’d have wanted
us to know. But I’m not so sure of the mother.
I caught her sending a warning to Helen with
her eyes, but it was too late.”</p>

<p>“That may have been simply because she knew
that it might make us suspicious and she wanted
to avoid that,” defended Tom. “That would be
natural enough for anyone to do. But it doesn’t
say that there is any ground for the suspicion.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the old man?” asked
Frank thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s just crazy,” said Tom carelessly.
“He’s touched in the upper story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“That might be just camouflage though, to
make us think that we could talk freely without
paying any attention to him,” objected Frank.
“He may be as crazy as a fox.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Billy. “He’s pretty
old and his mind is failing. I heard him half a
dozen times muttering something about ‘the cellar,
the cellar.’ It got on my nerves after a while.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let’s trouble trouble till trouble
troubles us,” counseled Frank. “There may be
nothing in it at all. I wouldn’t hang a yellow
dog on all the evidence we’ve got. In the meantime,
that bed looks inviting and I’m going to
tumble in early.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you there,” said Tom. “It’s so long
since I’ve slept between sheets that I’m anxious
to see how it feels.”</p>

<p>It was indeed a delightful contrast to their experiences
for months past, and they slept soundly
until they were called to breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with our leave today?”
asked Frank, as they were hurriedly dressing.</p>

<p>“Just loaf and invite our souls,” replied Tom,
as he put down his military brushes and took a
last look in the glass, with the fair Alice in mind.</p>

<p>“Luxemburg’s a tidy little city,” put in Billy,
“and there ought to be lots to see. Wouldn’t do,
I suppose, to take the girls along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Not on your young life,” said Frank emphatically.
“You’d get in the guardhouse so soon it
would make your head swim. What’s the matter
with you fellows, anyway? You’ve both been
primping up like a couple of dudes. Are you so
badly smitten?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” denied Tom stoutly, though a
deeper flush on his bronzed face might have given
rise to doubt.</p>

<p>“They’re certainly nice girls though,” said
Billy, feebly, “especially Helen.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t anything on Alice,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>“Lucky you haven’t picked out the same one,”
laughed Frank, “or I’d have my hands full in
keeping the peace. Come along now if you’re
ready.”</p>

<p>At the breakfast table they received the same
pleasant greeting as on the night before, but there
was a certain lack of freedom in the conversation
that all felt. The little element of suspicion that
had been aroused by Helen’s remark still persisted.
The boys kept a guard on their lips as
regarded all military matters, and as just at that
time there was little to talk about except the war,
the remarks made were few and far between and
they felt relieved when the meal was finished.
Perhaps Billy and Tom were exceptions, for although
they did not say much with their lips, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
eyes were eloquent in the glances they stole at the
girls.</p>

<p>It was necessary for the Army Boys to report
at the quarters of the regiment, but after that
formality was through with they had no difficulty
in getting leave and started off in high feather to
enjoy their unaccustomed freedom.</p>

<p>There was a host of places that well repaid
their visit, museums, picture galleries, the quaint
old world buildings, the great cathedral, and
others equally noteworthy. It was such a relief
to be among scenes of peace after the horrors
and bloodshed of so many months that they enjoyed
it doubly. They took their dinner at a
hotel, where though the prices were high the food
was surprisingly good, and toward evening returned
to the home where they had been billeted.</p>

<p>As they neared the house, they saw a man loitering
near it who seemed to have no special business
in the vicinity, but kept sauntering to and fro
smoking a cigar. As he saw them coming, he
hesitated a moment as though half inclined to
turn and go in the other direction, but seemed to
think better of it, giving them a quick, sharp look
as he passed them.</p>

<p>He was in civilian dress and at first they
thought he was a native of the place, but his face
showed that he was unmistakably an Englishman
or an American, they were not sure which.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Wonder what that fellow is hanging around
here for?” Tom remarked, as they went up the
steps of the house.</p>

<p>“Oh the streets are free—that is to every one
but a German, and that chap isn’t that,” remarked
Billy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s some lovelorn suitor of one of the
girls,” suggested Frank mischievously.</p>

<p>“I don’t like his face,” said Tom sourly.</p>

<p>“He has a villainous look,” added Billy.</p>

<p>“Jealous already, eh?” laughed Frank. “I
surely got your goat that time. He looks all
right to me. I’d better get you fellows into the
house before there’s murder done.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE LONE STRAGGLER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Army Boys</span> were getting ready for supper,
and Frank noted with some amusement that
under one pretext or another Tom and Billy
took occasion to go frequently to the window and
look out.</p>

<p>“Is he there yet?” he finally asked of Tom.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Tom innocently.</p>

<p>“That deadly rival of yours,” chaffed Frank.</p>

<p>Tom flushed a little.</p>

<p>“Quit your kidding,” he replied. “Yes, he is
there. I’ve half a mind to go out and ask him
why’s he hanging around.”</p>

<p>“I guess that would be assuming a little too
much,” laughed Frank; and as the summons to
supper came just then the matter was dropped.</p>

<p>“I hope you enjoyed your holiday today,” remarked
Mrs. Edsall, when they were seated at
the table.</p>

<p>“Very much,” Frank answered. “Luxemburg
is a charming city. We only wish we were going
to be in it longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“It is a nice place,” said Mrs. Edsall. “But
we shall be glad to leave it just the same.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave it?” asked Billy in
some surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied his hostess. “We are going
back to Coblenz. My father’s property was
seized there by the Germans when we left, and we
are anxious to go back to reclaim it, now that the
city is going to be under American control.”</p>

<p>Tom and Billy did not attempt to disguise their
pleasure at the news, but Frank, although he politely
expressed himself to the same effect, was
not without a certain uneasiness. All his doubts
of the night before came back to him.</p>

<p>Was business the real reason why the family
were returning? Or was it because their sympathies
and affections called them back to German
soil? It was certain that the old man, whatever
he may have been when he left Coblenz four
years before, was now in no shape to carry on
business. Still, of course, the family would
naturally want to get back their property, even if
only to sell it and afterward go to America.</p>

<p>He stole a glance at the old man. The latter
had brightened visibly when Coblenz had been
mentioned, but he soon relapsed into his usual
silence broken only by muttered references to “the
cellar.”</p>

<p>Frank made up his mind that he would speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
to his chums again about the matter. But after
supper, the party adjourned to the living room,
where the girls played and sang to them, and
Billy and Tom were in such high spirits when the
boys finally went up to their rooms that Frank
concluded not to dampen their pleasure by bringing
the matter up.</p>

<p>The next morning they took their leave, with
many thanks for the hospitality that had been extended
to them and expressions of hope that they
would see them again in Coblenz. Billy and Tom
laid especial stress on this latter point and Helen
and Alice did not seem at all averse to the prospect.</p>

<p>The regiment started off again on its long
“hike,” refreshed and rested after its two days’
stay in Luxemburg. Their journey soon brought
them to the Moselle river with its quaint villages
and picturesque castles and they pursued their
way along its banks for many miles. They were
not yet on German soil, though they were rapidly
approaching it.</p>

<p>In every place they entered, they were received
as deliverers. The people turned out in force to
greet them with acclamations. And they all had
American flags ready to wave in honor of the
Americans. Many were not just sure how the
flags ought to be made, and there were often as
many stripes as there were stars. In some places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the people had no cloth, as almost every scrap of
it had been carried away by the Germans, but
they used paper instead, and although the results
were not always artistic and in fact were sometimes
laughable, none of the boys laughed, for
they knew how deep the emotion was that
prompted the demonstrations.</p>

<p>One day when they were taking their noonday
rest of two hours, the boys saw Dick Lever coming
toward them. They fell upon him with delight.</p>

<p>“Well, Dick, old man, is it really you?” asked
Frank, after they had pounded and mauled him
to their hearts’ content.</p>

<p>“Nobody else,” grinned Dick, as he released
himself. “What kind of a rough house do you
call this anyway?”</p>

<p>“How does it feel not to bring down your daily
German?” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“It sure is monotonous for a fact,” said Dick,
a little regretfully. “I find myself looking
around every once in a while to see if one of them
is bearing down on me. But there’s no such luck.
I’ll get rusty after a while from lack of practice.”</p>

<p>“You may have another hack at them, if they
refuse to sign the peace treaty,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“Swell chance,” returned Dick. “We’ve taken
all the fight out of those fellows. They haven’t
a bit left. Have you heard about the way they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
surrendered their fleet? Some of the finest battleships
in the world, and they gave them up like
so many lambs. Think of an American navy giving
up that way without one last desperate fight.
But Heinie isn’t built that way.”</p>

<p>“How does it seem up there in the air to watch
the American army marching toward the Rhine?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Bully,” replied Dick. “I always felt certain
I’d see them going in that direction but I didn’t
dare to hope it would be so soon. From up there
I can see not only our boys but the Huns as well
going back to explain how it happened that they
were making tracks for Berlin instead of toward
Paris, and I tell you the sight makes me feel
mighty good.</p>

<p>“One funny thing I noticed yesterday,” he went
on. “Our whole army had passed on, or I
thought they had, when I saw a man marching
along about three miles behind them. He was
all alone, but he was marching as stiff and
straight as though his captain was looking at him.
Then every once in a while he would stop and go
through the whole manual of arms. Then up
would go his gun again and he’d march on.</p>

<p>“It struck me as strange and I watched him
for a while. He went through that performance
a half dozen times. I got out my glasses for a
better look and saw that he was ragged and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
looked down at the heel. I had half a mind to
go down and see what it all meant, but just then
I got a signal from the flight commander and had
to go forward. But it sure struck me as queer.”</p>

<p>“Some straggler that had been left behind and
was trying to catch up with his regiment, I suppose,”
suggested Billy.</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t explain why he went through
the drill movements,” replied Dick.</p>

<p>Frank had been listening, carelessly at first but
with growing interest. Now he leaned forward
and asked earnestly:</p>

<p>“Did you see the man’s face, Dick?”</p>

<p>“No, I was almost directly above him and he
didn’t look up.”</p>

<p>“Dick,” went on Frank with growing excitement,
“do me a favor. Keep a sharp watch for
that man and if you catch sight of him swoop
right down and get in touch with him.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Dick curiously, “but why?”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied Frank, and his voice was
tense, “it may be Bart!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>ON GERMAN SOIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys sprang excitedly to their feet.</p>

<p>“Bart!” exclaimed Billy huskily.</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s just a guess,” explained
Frank, “and I may be all wrong. But it seems to
me it’s a reasonable guess. From what Dick
says, the man seems to be out of his head. No
sane man would go through all those drill motions
all by himself. And you know that Bart
was always a crank on the manual of arms.
There wasn’t a quicker or smarter man at drill in
the whole Thirty-seventh. We know that poor
Bart was out of his head when he escaped from
the hospital. What more natural than that his
twisted ideas should go back to the very thing
that he used to be most interested in?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I shouldn’t wonder if you might be
right!” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“Then, too, what Dick said about his being
ragged would chime in with that,” exclaimed
Tom. “If he were just an ordinary straggler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
trying to catch up with the regiment, he’d be
dressed all right anyway. You know how strict
the officers are that the men should look smart.
But poor Bart only had on his night clothes when
he got away from the hospital, and he’s probably
picked up pieces of clothing here and there as he
had a chance. Say, fellows, can’t we get the
officers to let us go back and look into the matter?”</p>

<p>“We’ll try,” said Frank, “but I’m afraid they’d
think it was a wild goose chase. But at any rate,
Dick is freer than we are and I’m sure he’ll do
the best he can for us. Won’t you, Dick?”</p>

<p>“You bet I will,” replied Dick warmly. “Poor
Bart was a prince, and there isn’t anything I
wouldn’t do for him or for you. The more I
think of it, the more I’m inclined to think that
Frank may be right. There isn’t a free minute
when I won’t be looking for the poor fellow.”</p>

<p>“Even if it shouldn’t be Bart, he ought to be
taken care of,” said Frank. “Just wait a minute,
Dick, until I see the captain and try to get
permission to go back with a squad and hunt him
up.”</p>

<p>He was off like a shot, but returned in a few
minutes disappointed and chagrined. The captain
had listened with sympathy, but the chance
seemed to him too remote to depart from the
strict orders he had received to keep all the regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
together on this momentous march. He
promised, however, to notify the rear guard to
keep their eyes open, and if they caught sight of
the straggler, if he were such, to gather him in.
And with this promise Frank had to be content.</p>

<p>Dick left them with a repeated promise to do
all he could, and the march was resumed with the
Army Boys in a high state of excitement. In their
hearts they knew that it was only a chance and
that they might be doomed to bitter disappointment.
But as Frank had said, it was at least a
reasonable guess, and their hearts swelled with
delight at the mere possibility of having dear old
Bart back with them again. Even if his mind
were wandering, they felt sure that with the care
he would receive he would soon be himself again.</p>

<p>The absence of their comrade had been the one
bitter drop in their cup of happiness over the beating
of the Hun. Half the delight in the victory
would be gone unless their loved comrade could
share the triumph with them.</p>

<p>They could talk of little else all the rest of
that day, and many a glance was directed at the
fleet of aeroplanes flying overhead. One of
these, they knew, was Dick’s, and they were sure
that that trusty friend was “on the job.”</p>

<p>All that day they kept passing huge piles of
war material that had been left behind by the
Germans under the terms of armistice. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
were guns by the hundred, heavy and light. Most
of them were camouflaged with all the colors of
the rainbow. This had been unnecessary while
the Germans were fighting in entrenched positions,
but when the rapid advance of the Allies
had forced the Germans to put up their guns
hastily in the best positions they could find
they had painted them in order to dazzle and bewilder
the eyes of their enemies.</p>

<p>“All that good paint wasted,” chuckled Billy, as
he looked at the grim monsters, silent now, that a
little while before had been belching out their
messengers of death.</p>

<p>There were airplanes too, scores of them, some
of them the famous “flying tanks,” so called because
they had a metal armor about them to ward
off enemy bullets. The Army Boys looked at
them with great curiosity and would have liked to
stop to examine them at leisure, but had to keep
on in the steadily marching ranks.</p>

<p>They could look across into Germany now,
where on the other side of the river, the German
forces were withdrawing. It was a strange sensation
to see a German and not snatch up a gun to
hurry his movements.</p>

<p>While they were pitching camp that night,
Billy suddenly nudged Frank, as a man passed
them in earnest conversation with one of the
officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Look at that fellow,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Frank looked at the man indicated.</p>

<p>“Why it’s the man we saw hanging around
Mrs. Edsall’s house!” he remarked with interest.
“I wonder what he’s doing here?”</p>

<p>“Seems to have the run of the camp all right,”
observed Tom with a scowl.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that shows he’s all right,”
returned Frank. “You’ve got no cause to kick,
Tom, nor Billy either. You know now that he
isn’t hanging around the girls.”</p>

<p>“No, but it looks as though he were going
along with the army to Coblenz,” said Billy uneasily.</p>

<p>“And the girls are going to be there soon, eh?”
teased Frank. “Gee, but I’m glad that I’m not in
love.”</p>

<p>“Who said we were?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, nobody,” laughed Frank. “I’ve got a
pretty good pair of eyes in my head, though.”</p>

<p>No news came from Dick that night, although
the boys were looking for him to turn up at any
moment. Either he had seen nothing of their
missing comrade, or his duties had prevented him
from joining them.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” Frank consoled his comrades,
when they were forced to turn in. “Tomorrow’s
a new day. My hunch is growing stronger that
I was right about poor Bart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>The next day was the one fixed for the Army
to enter Germany. At last they were reaching the
goal that they had aimed at ever since they had
come to France. The arrogant country that had
sought to enslave Europe was to feel the foot of
the victor on her own soil, that she had so
haughtily declared to be “sacred.”</p>

<p>They reached the bridge that had been designated
for the crossing. Then with bands crashing
out their martial music and the Stars and
Stripes floating proudly overhead, the American
Army swung across the bridge and entered as
conquerors on German soil.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>AS FROM THE DEAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a good-sized city into which the army
marched, and the streets were full of people.
There were other thousands who peered from behind
window curtains at the hated newcomers,
these Americans, who, they had been told by their
lying government, could never get to France, and
who, if they did get there, would run at the sight
of German uniforms. They <i>had</i> run, but they
had run after the Germans instead of away from
them, and that trifling fact had made all the difference
in the world.</p>

<p>There was no demonstration of any kind. The
people looked on in sullen silence. Only the children
showed interest. They were too young to
understand what the coming of the Americans
meant to their elders, and the flying flags and
stirring music appealed to them as a spectacle and
delighted them.</p>

<p>The American authorities took charge of the
town and issued proclamations telling the people
just how they were to conduct themselves under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the American occupation. The ordinary business
of the town was to go on as usual, and the civil
authorities would not be interfered with as long
as good order was maintained. After a certain
hour at night, no citizen was to be allowed on the
streets. American officers were to be saluted
when they passed. Hats were to be lifted when
the American flag appeared and when the American
national air was played. The people were
warned that the rules were to be strictly obeyed
and that any disorder would be sharply and instantly
repressed.</p>

<p>“And they’re getting off mighty easy at that,”
grumbled Tom. “What we ought to do is to
give them a taste of their own medicine. We
ought to post up the same regulations here that
the Germans did in the towns of France and Belgium.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t do that,” objected Frank. “They
were brutes and those things came natural to
them. But we’re Americans.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you’re right,” admitted Tom.
“Just the same it makes my blood boil at the contrast
between what they deserve and what they’re
getting. Look at these streets and houses, not
showing a mark of war, and then picture the
towns of France and Belgium, where only heaps
of rubbish mark the passage of the Hun.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of that,” broke in Billy, “here’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
picture post-card that I picked up in the street a
little while ago. It shows a group of Germans
destroying the machinery in a French mill,
smashing delicate and costly machinery to bits.
The Germans had stopped working for a few
minutes, so that they could be photographed and
the pictures could be published in Germany.
That’s what it is that makes the case of the Huns
so hopeless. If any other nation did such things,
it wouldn’t at least brag of it. But the Huns are
actually proud of it. The dirtier the deed the
greater the pride.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Frank, “and I heard of a case
where they sank lower still. After they had
taken a picture of a mill they had broken up, very
similar to this, they sent one of the pictures to the
former French owner of the mill, and the picture
had written on it: ‘This is the way your mill
looks now.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, what’s the use,” growled Billy.
“We’ve licked them and licked them good and
proper. We’ll have to let it go at that, though I
think as Tom does, that they ought to get a stiffer
dose.”</p>

<p>“One thing is certain,” grunted Tom, “and that
is if I’m a member of the provost-marshal’s
guard in this town, I’ll make these fellows walk
Spanish if they look cross-eyed at me.”</p>

<p>But Tom had no chance for this, for in another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
day or two the regiment went on, while
other units of the division remained to garrison
the town.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the boys had seen Dick, but
to their disappointment he had no definite news
for them. Only once more had he caught sight
of the lonely figure, but while he was manœuvring
his machine to make a descent the man
had disappeared. He landed and made a search,
but without result. Since that time he had kept
a sharp lookout, but had seen no further trace of
him.</p>

<p>“But I’ll keep on looking,” promised Dick.
“I’m getting just as much excited about this mystery
as you fellows are yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Here’s hoping,” replied Frank. “But it
wrings my heart to think of poor Bart, if it is he,
wandering around in that forlorn way. I only
wish that we could get off to look for him.”</p>

<p>They were passing through the country districts
now and the villages at which they stopped
at night could not accommodate the men in their
houses. These were occupied by the officers,
while the men stayed in their tents.</p>

<p>The weather was getting colder, and the men
had extra blankets served out to them. These
were ample to keep them warm, but one morning
Frank awoke shivering. Reveille had not yet
sounded, and he turned over for another “forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
winks” and drew his blankets closer. But he
was still chilly, and on investigation he found
that one of his blankets had disappeared.</p>

<p>At first he thought that either Tom or Billy
must have played a joke on him. He went over
to where they lay, but they only had their regular
quota, and they protested so vigorously
against being disturbed that he let them alone.
Later when he questioned them about the matter,
they denied knowing anything about it.</p>

<p>“It must have been one of the fellows from
another tent,” suggested Billy. “He’s felt cold
in the night and has come in and swiped yours.
Pretty small potatoes, I call it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to catch him doing it,” growled Frank.
“I’d make it so warm for him that he wouldn’t
feel any need of blankets.”</p>

<p>“He’s got his nerve with him to swipe things
from the best boxer in the regiment,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>“You’d better bone the quartermaster for another
blanket,” counseled Billy.</p>

<p>Frank got another blanket in the course of the
day and that night he tucked it in around him
with unusual care. It would take some tugging
to get that away from him.</p>

<p>It must have been considerably after midnight
when he was conscious of something that disturbed
him. But he was very tired, and after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
moment he turned over to go to sleep again.
Then came a distinct tug at the blanket that had
him awake in an instant.</p>

<p>It was very dark in the tent, but he could discern
dimly the figure of a man standing beside
him.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought Frank grimly to himself, “my
fine fellow, here’s where you get the shock of
your young life.”</p>

<p>He gathered himself for a spring, leaped to
his feet and grappled with the intruder. The
latter tried to escape, but Frank launched himself
into him with such impetus that they both went
down together.</p>

<p>The head of the unknown struck the ground
hard and he lay still. Frank was alarmed.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he called, as Tom and Billy, aroused
by the fracas, rushed toward him. “Strike a
match, one of you.”</p>

<p>Billy did so, and as the light flashed upon the
face of the prostrate man they gave a shout.</p>

<p>“Bart!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>A JOYOUS REUNION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Bart!</span>” Frank repeated with a groan. “And
perhaps I’ve killed him!”</p>

<p>Tom lighted a candle while Billy rushed for
his canteen. They dashed some of its contents
into Bart’s pallid face and chafed his hands and
wrists.</p>

<p>In a few minutes their vigorous efforts had
results. Bart moved uneasily, his eyes opened
and rested vacantly at first and then intelligently
upon the faces of his friends.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows!” he murmured weakly.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>Their joy was beyond measure. Even while
they were seeking to restore him to consciousness
they had been tormented by the fear of seeing
only an insane gleam in his eyes when he should
open them.</p>

<p>“Bart, old man!” cried Frank, in a voice that
broke despite all efforts to control it. “You know
us, then?”</p>

<p>“Know you?” repeated Bart wonderingly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
trying to raise himself, a movement which they
gently checked. “Of course I know you. Are
you kidding me?”</p>

<p>“Listen, Bart,” replied Frank with a warning
glance at his companions not to reveal prematurely
the whole story. “You got a knock on the
head in the fighting that put you out of business
for a while and we’ve been a little scared. But
you’re all right now.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m all right,” answered Bart, “and I’ll
be ready tomorrow to take another crack at the
Huns. How is the battle going?”</p>

<p>“All to the good,” answered Frank. “But
you’d better lie still for a while. We’ll put you
on my bed and you won’t have even a headache
in the morning.”</p>

<p>Bart protested, but they overruled him and
tucked him in the blankets, where he promptly
went to sleep. Then Frank went in search of one
of the doctors who came promptly. He listened
with the greatest interest while the three chums
told their story. Then he made as careful an
examination of Bart as he could without waking
him.</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right, I think,” was his verdict.
“He’s fairly well nourished. I suppose he’s
found plenty of food in the wake of the army.
And the life in the open air has built him up after
his hospital experience. The only trouble has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
been with his mind, and from what you tell me
he’s come to himself again. Of course he’ll have
to take things easy for the next few days and
you mustn’t tell him now about his hospital escapade.
Let him think the injury happened to
him yesterday. We’ll take him along in one of
the ambulances, and I venture to say that in a
week he’ll be with you again as well as ever.”</p>

<p>“I can’t forgive myself for knocking him
down,” said Frank mournfully.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed.</p>

<p>“Best thing you ever did in your life,” he said.
“The blow he got on the head was just what he
needed to shake him into sanity again. Medical
history is full of just such cases. You’ve got the
proof of it right here. He was undoubtedly insane
when he came into the tent to take your
blanket. He knew that he was cold and his only
thought was to get something to keep him warm.”</p>

<p>“But why should he happen to strike our tent
instead of somebody else’s?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Because he knew it was yours,” answered the
doctor. “In his poor twisted brain he had recognized
you and knew vaguely that you were his
friends. Probably he has been dodging around
somewhere and kept track of you.”</p>

<p>The boys’ eyes grew moist as the pathos of it
all came upon them.</p>

<p>The doctor left them some stimulating medicine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
promised to send the ambulance around in
the morning and took his leave.</p>

<p>There was no more sleep for the boys the rest
of that night. They were strung to too high a
pitch of excitement and delight. They felt as
though they were treading on air.</p>

<p>Bart was back with them again, dear old Bart,
whose absence they had mourned as though he
had been their brother, brave old Bart, with the
heart of a lion, who had stood at their side
in a score of desperate fights. For hours they sat
outside the tent so that they would not disturb
the sleeper, and talked in low voices of the great
thing that had happened.</p>

<p>Bart woke in the morning refreshed and perfectly
himself again as far as his mind was concerned.
They fed him well and when the ambulance
came around they helped to put him in it,
promising to drop round to see him whenever
they could get leave. The ambulance went along
with the army, so that the boys had the feeling
that Bart was with them all the time, even though
not stepping along in the ranks.</p>

<p>Dick dropped in on them during the day, as
did Will Stone, who was going along in one of
the tank units of the army of occupation, and
their delight was almost as great as that of the
Army Boys themselves when they heard the news.
Together they went to visit Bart at every opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
they had, and rejoiced to find that he was
getting stronger all the time.</p>

<p>The nurse who had him in charge had been
told his story, and, being a person of tact and
discretion, she had gradually told him the truth
bit by bit, “in homeopathic doses,” as Tom put it.
The absence of the noise of the big guns was
rather hard to explain, but she did it somehow,
and finally Bart came to know the whole truth.
It was something of a shock to him, but his delight
at the defeat and surrender of the Huns was
so great that it more than counterbalanced his
distress.</p>

<p>In a few days, the doctor pronounced him
strong enough to take his regular place in the
ranks, and when he stepped out with them one
morning in a brand new uniform and looking
as stalwart and fit as ever he had, the Army
Boys felt as though they had nothing on earth
left to ask for. And their delight was shared by
the rest of the regiment, with whom Bart was a
general favorite, and who overwhelmed him with
handshakes and congratulations. The boys
marked that day as the best that had ever been
on their calendar.</p>

<p>All were in a jubilant mood as they strode along
in the crisp, cool air. It was almost a trial to
keep their measured step. They all felt more like
dancing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“The only kick I have was that I wasn’t in at
the finish,” said Bart. “I’d like to have heard
the last shot fired. And I sure would have liked
to have been with you fellows in the tunnel, and
in the clearing of that Argonne Forest. You fellows
were certainly going fast in those last days
of the war.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t kick,” grinned Billy. “You’re
some speed merchant yourself. You went to
sleep in France and woke up in Germany.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>CROSSING THE RHINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a memorable day when the Army Boys
at last looked upon the Rhine. Again and again
that word had been on their lips in the course of
the war. A thousand times they had pledged
themselves to reach the Rhine. The river was
to them a symbol of Germany itself.</p>

<p>Into the city of Coblenz poured the American
army in columns that seemed endless. Over the
Rhine they went on two bridges that spanned the
great river that stretched out like a broad silver
ribbon as far as their eyes could see. At last the
Rhine was under American control, and a German
could not even cross it without permission
from an American sentry.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river from Coblenz
was the great fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, one of
the strongest and most famous in Germany. It
covered many acres and stood on a rocky promontory,
four hundred feet above the level of the
river. It could hold a hundred thousand men if
necessary. It had cisterns hewed out of the solid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
rock that could hold water enough to supply a
garrison of eight thousand men for ten years.
There were mammoth underground passages and
magazines for supplies and ammunition. From
its rocky height it seemed to be able to defy the
world.</p>

<p>The German flag had floated over the fortress
for a hundred years. Now Old Glory was hoisted
in its place and the pulses of the boys thrilled as
the Stars and Stripes spread out proudly in the
breeze.</p>

<p>Part of the army was stationed in Coblenz, but
many thousands were placed in the fortress itself,
which was henceforth to serve as American barracks.</p>

<p>Then for the first time since they had landed in
France the American army really rested. Their
main work was done and well done. They had
fought the good fight. They had kept the faith.</p>

<p>Not that the army discipline grew lax. The
men were kept in shape for any emergency. At
a day’s notice if necessary they could resume
fighting. But there were many hours every day
that they had to themselves and they were as full
of high spirits as so many colts turned out to
pasture.</p>

<p>On one such day after they had had some good
wrestling and boxing matches Billy’s effervescence
found vent in an offer to sing them a song<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
“so pathetic that it will bring tears to your eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out that stuff,” chaffed Bart. “Isn’t
there enough trouble in the world without your
singing songs to make us weep?”</p>

<p>“Aw, this isn’t going to be the kind of a song
you think it is,” protested Billy. “This song
isn’t aimed to make you shed tears of sadness,
the one and only idea being to double you
up with spontaneous and irresistible laughter.
You’ve heard the old saying, haven’t you, ‘to
laugh till you cry’? Of course you have, and
that’s what I have in mind.”</p>

<p>“I never knew you had a gift for singing comic
songs,” said Tom, suspiciously, “and what’s
more, I don’t mind going a little further and saying
I didn’t know you could sing any kind of a
song at all.”</p>

<p>“That just goes to show how ignorant you
are,” retorted Billy, “you just wait till you hear
me sing this song, and see if it isn’t every bit as
good as I say it is.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of this wonderful composition?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“The name?” said Billy. “Why, I don’t see
any real reason why I shouldn’t tell you. The
name of this song is: ‘I Want a Good Egg, and I
Want It Bad.’ The accompaniment will be rendered——”
but this was as far as he got, as a
shout of laughter went up, and he became the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
target for whatever miscellaneous objects happened
at that moment to be closest to hand.</p>

<p>“The title to that song is plenty,” observed
Frank, when the disturbance had somewhat
quieted down; “speaking for myself, I’m not
curious to see if the music is as bad as the egg.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Billy, aggrievedly, “it
isn’t as bad, it’s worse. That’s what makes the
song so funny.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” said Tom, “that you’re about
the only one in this man’s army who does like it,
so I’d advise you to drop it while you’re still alive
and healthy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, then,” said Billy, “if you fellows
haven’t got sense enough to recognize a
little musical gem when it is offered to you, you
can go without. But please remember that you’re
the losers, not me.”</p>

<p>“It’s nice of you to feel sorry for us,” said
Frank, “but just you save up that song to sing to
a bunch of Boches. Of course it will be hard even
on the Huns, but they’re used to atrocities by this
time.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Billy in an injured
tone. “I know a German isn’t much good, but
with all their faults they do appreciate good
music.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we weren’t talking about <i>good</i>
music,” remarked Bart pointedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“I don’t seem to make a hit with this crowd,”
said Billy plaintively. “One of you fellows see
if you can do better.”</p>

<p>“I heard a good joke the other day,” volunteered
Tom, “and I wouldn’t mind telling it if
somebody coaxed me a little bit.”</p>

<p>“Consider yourself coaxed,” said Bart. “Go
ahead and shoot the works.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “it seems that in one of the
recruiting camps an officer was questioning some
of the men with an idea of finding out what they
would do in a certain emergency. As he went
down the line, he came to a darky.</p>

<p>“‘Now, ’Rastus,’ the officer said, ‘suppose you
were out in an open field on scouting duty, and
suddenly you saw a whole regiment of Germans
running toward you, bayonets fixed and ready
for business. What would you do?’</p>

<p>“‘Whut would ah do? Why, boss, ah wouldn’t
do a thing. Ah’d just say tuh mah feet: “Feet,
do yuh duty,” and, boss, ah’m mighty suah dey
would.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>THE CELLAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A burst</span> of laughter greeted the climax of
Tom’s story.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Bart, “I propose that we
wander over to the canteen and proceed to wrap
ourselves around some apple pie and a few large
and succulent doughnuts.”</p>

<p>The proposition met with instant acclaim, and
without further debate the boys streamed off to
the canteen where were sold the delicacies that
made a special appeal to the soldiers after the
regulation “chow.” They found the place
crowded, but there was always room for more,
and they squeezed their way in and demanded that
the man behind the counter “shake a mean foot”
and place before them the required “eats.” This
was done, and big chunks of pie disappeared in
magical fashion.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Billy, with a deep sigh of
satisfaction. “If I ever get back home again,
I’m going to enter myself in a pie-eating contest.
I’ll probably become champion of the world, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
even if I’m not, it will be an awful lot of fun
trying.”</p>

<p>“The rest of us would run you a pretty good
race,” grinned Tom.</p>

<p>“You think so, eh?” Billy came back at him.
“All right, I’ll challenge you all as soon as we
get back to the States and may the best man
win.”</p>

<p>“The loser of course to pay the bill,” laughed
Bart.</p>

<p>“Agreed,” replied Billy, “and now just to keep
in training I’ll take another piece of that pie.
Shoot it over, waiter, and make it snappy.”</p>

<p>At last even Billy’s voracious appetite was satisfied.</p>

<p>“Come along now, you cormorant,” said Tom.
“You know we’ve got that appointment in Coblenz
this afternoon and we haven’t got any too
much time.”</p>

<p>“Are you fellows going across the river this
afternoon?” asked Frank in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Tom, with a slight tinge of
embarrassment. “Don’t you want to come
along?”</p>

<p>Frank looked from Tom to Billy and a light
broke in upon him.</p>

<p>“Not I,” he laughed. “I’m next to you fellows.
Trot along and give my regards to Helen
and Alice. I didn’t know the family had reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Coblenz yet. But trust you fellows to find that
out.”</p>

<p>Billy and Tom smiled a little sheepishly.</p>

<p>“They got there yesterday,” Billy explained.</p>

<p>“Bless you, my children, bless you,” said Frank
mockingly. “Run along now and don’t keep the
girls waiting. But all the same, fellows,” he
added more seriously, “don’t get in too deep until
you know that they’re loyal to the old U. S. A.”</p>

<p>“I’d stake my life on it,” replied Billy warmly.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” laughed Frank, “but just now, old
man, you may not be a very good judge. Only
be careful, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Two days later there was a grand review of
the Army of Occupation. General Pershing
himself had come to Coblenz for that purpose and
the marching and countermarching of that great
array of troops on a plain outside the city was a
magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p>But the great feature of the day to the Army
Boys was when they and a number of others were
called out in front of the entire division and decorated
with the Distinguished Service Cross.
Frank got his for “extraordinary heroism,” as
the citation called it, in capturing the machine
gun and its crew single-handed. Tom and Billy
were honored for their exploit in the tunnel affair
while Bart was decorated for the occasion when
in company with Frank he had rowed out into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
the river and blown up the bridge over which the
Germans were charging. The General himself
pinned on the medals, and it was a proud group
of Army Boys who trudged back to their quarters
with the honors on their breasts after the
review was ended.</p>

<p>They had done these things without the slightest
thought of reward and simply because they
loved their country. But it was good all the same
to feel that Uncle Sam was not ungrateful.</p>

<p>Before they left the field, Frank had another
pleasure. Colonel Pavet came over to him and
congratulated him on his honors which, he declared,
had never been better deserved.</p>

<p>“And at last I have the news that I have been
hoping for for weeks,” he said. “I heard from
Andre this morning that your mother’s property
has at last been awarded to her. The last formality
is settled, and if she were here she could
take possession tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Frank wrung the colonel’s hand and thanked
him with all his heart.</p>

<p>“I shall write my mother tonight,” he said.
“I’ll do better than that! I’ll cable. She will be
relieved and delighted beyond measure.”</p>

<p>“And tell her when you write,” smiled the
colonel, “that when she is able to come over, I
would be delighted to have both you and her
spend as much time as possible on my estate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>Frank promised and they parted with warm
expressions of mutual regard. And that same
night a cable message sped across the Atlantic
bearing the good news that Frank was too impatient
to wait for a letter to tell her.</p>

<p>A week or two later, the American authorities
at Coblenz found it necessary to institute stricter
measures. It was found that a large amount of
material that should have been left to the American
army by the terms of the armistice had been
sold to unscrupulous buyers who had purchased
it for a song and stored it away to be sold at a
large profit later on.</p>

<p>A search was made throughout the city and
many hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of
the goods were recovered. In looking about for
a temporary place to store it, the authorities had
commandeered a warehouse which was partly
empty. Here they placed the goods and put them
under guard of American soldiers.</p>

<p>One night the Army Boys were sent over to
relieve the squad then on duty. As they reached
the place, Tom and Billy gave an involuntary exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Billy, “this is the warehouse
of Mrs. Edsall’s father. Their dwelling house is
right next door and connects with this.”</p>

<p>“You ought to know,” grinned Frank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
“You’ve been here often enough. But it’s rather
a queer coincidence that we should be sent to
guard it.”</p>

<p>They entered the cellar where the bulk of the
goods was stored.</p>

<p>“So this is the famous ‘cellar’ that the old man
was always muttering about,” remarked Frank,
as he looked curiously about him.</p>

<p>“The identical place,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>It was a long and wide cellar with many bales
and barrels stored in it. The only light was from
a lantern which had been lighted by the squad
they had just relieved, and which hung from a
beam at one end, leaving most of the place in
darkness.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>FOILING THE GERMAN PLOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">This</span> cellar’s a nice place to tell ghost stories
in,” remarked Bart. “It would make a fellow
creepy to be in here all by his lonesome.”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a noise down in that end of
the cellar,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“You’re dreaming,” said Billy. “Come out of
your trance.”</p>

<p>But just then there was another noise that all
of them heard. It sounded like a scratching
noise, or as though someone were inserting a key
in a lock.</p>

<p>“Quick!” whispered Frank. “Hold your guns
ready and get down behind these bales.”</p>

<p>Like a flash they obeyed and waited with bated
breath for what should come next.</p>

<p>The scratching continued. Then slowly a door
swung open at the far end of the cellar and a
figure advanced carrying a candle. He walked
with faltering steps, and as he drew nearer they
could see that it was Mrs. Edsall’s father.</p>

<p>He paused at a part of the wall that was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
shadow and seemed to be searching for something.
Then with a sigh of satisfaction he found
it. He pressed a spring and a concealed door
opened, revealing a small aperture.</p>

<p>The old man reached in his hand and brought
out a roll of papers. He glanced over them for
a moment in the light of the candle. Then he
swung the door shut and turned to go.</p>

<p>But just then there was a startling interruption.
From behind a barrel in whose shadow he
had been hiding, a man leaped out, and throwing
himself on the old man grasped the papers and
tore them from him.</p>

<p>The attack was stunning in its suddenness, but
the man had scarcely straightened up before the
Army Boys had swarmed out of their concealment
and seized the intruder. He put up a sharp
fight, but in the grasp of those sinewy arms he
was helpless. In a moment they had overpowered
him. The old man stood by, shaking as
though with a palsy.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Frank sharply to the intruder,
“what does this mean? Tom, bring that lantern
here and let’s have a look at this man.”</p>

<p>Tom did so, and as the light fell on the man’s
face he uttered an exclamation of surprise that
was echoed by Frank and Billy.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Frank, “it’s the man we saw in
Luxemburg!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“I don’t know where you saw me and I don’t
care,” answered the stranger angrily. “I only
warn you that you’ll get in trouble if you interfere
with me in the discharge of my duty. I’m
a member of the United States Secret Service.”</p>

<p>“Show your authority,” said Frank, taken a
little aback. “Let go his arms, fellows.”</p>

<p>His arms released, the man threw back his coat
and showed the badge of his service.</p>

<p>“I’ve been trailing this man for some time,”
he said. “We had a suspicion that he was in
treasonable relations with the enemy. And I
think now I’ve got the goods on him,” he said,
as he flourished the bundle of papers.</p>

<p>Here the old man interposed.</p>

<p>“It’s false,” he cried wildly. “No one is more
loyal than I am. Look at those papers. Look
quick or it may be too late. The Germans plotted
to blow up the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, if it
were ever captured by the Americans. Those are
the plans. By an oversight of theirs, the papers
fell into my hands. I hid them here when I had
to leave Coblenz. I did not dare to take them
with me for fear I would be searched. That
was why I wanted to get back to Coblenz, so that
I could give the papers to the American commander.
I have been sick, delirious since I returned,
and this is the first time I have been able
to leave my bed and get here. Look at the plans.
And hurry, hurry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>There was unmistakable sincerity in his tones
that startled and impressed even the Secret Service
agent. They hurriedly examined the plans.
Two minutes sufficed. Ehrenbreitstein, where at
that moment thousands of American soldiers
were sleeping, might at any moment be blown
into atoms!</p>

<p>Two jumps carried Frank out of the cellar. A
few more took him to a telephone. There was a
quick exchange between him and the fortress.
Then the whole party bundled themselves into a
car which had been hastily commandeered and
were whirled over the bridge and up the hill. A
few minutes more, and squads of soldiers, armed
to the teeth, had followed the indications of the
plans and located enough explosives in a secret
passage deep under the fortress to shatter it to
fragments. The wires by which they could have
been exploded from a distance were found and
severed, and only then did the commander of the
fortress, who had lived ten years in as many minutes,
venture to breathe freely. The bold plot of
a desperate band of Germans had been foiled.</p>

<p>But other plots were still to be exposed, and
what some of those were will be related in the
next volume of this series, to be entitled: “Army
Boys on German Soil; Or, Our Doughboys Quelling
the Mobs.” In that book we shall meet all our
friends again and see how bravely they acted
under the most trying of circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“It was a narrow squeak,” remarked Frank, a
few days after the German plot had been exposed.</p>

<p>“Just what I was saying to Helen this afternoon,”
said Billy.</p>

<p>“And what were you saying to Alice?” asked
Bart, turning to Tom.</p>

<p>“None of your business,” grinned Tom.</p>

<p>“They’re hopeless cases,” remarked Bart.</p>

<p>“Cupid’s got the best of them,” remarked
Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s more than the Huns could do,”
laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Frank. “That’s more than the
Huns could do. They tried their best, but they
couldn’t put it over on Uncle Sam’s Army Boys.”</p>

<p>Vance Barnum is a real treasure when it
comes to telling about how magicians do their
weird tricks, how the circus acrobats pull off
their various stunts, how the “fishman” remains
under water so long, how the mid-air
performers loop the loop and how the slack-wire
fellow keeps from tumbling. He has been
through it all and he writes freely for the boys
from his vast experience. They are real stories
bound to hold their audiences breathlessly.</p>
